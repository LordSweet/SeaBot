Accompany him as he discovers the Easter Island full of large mysterious statues (30 contracts). As Jacob moves on, you will welcome the next visitor to the island <b>Felipe Gonzáles de Ahedo</b> and explore the island with him (30 contracts).

The clouds will once again reveal the land underneath as you explore the hidden areas. Look for treasure and materials that are waiting for you in the unknown lands!</li> <li>The main contractors will ask of you the three new commodities: bunnies, moai, and  tulips. You can find these commodities in the new destinations on the main uncovered map (destination for tulips is hidden under cloud explored on level 35). If you collect materials from the floating eggs in your port, you can also collect the daisies. These you can trade on the market just like all the other commodities.</li> <li>Apart from the main contracts, you can also meet Felipe and Jacob while exploring the map. They have for you a few special contracts.<ul> <li> Three contracts will require the special commodity - key. The key can be collected from our fanpage and will be used only in these three contracts. You won’t be able to sell it on the market either. These contracts will be unlocked on the day we post the keys on our fanpage.</li> <li>Three different contracts will contain a riddle. Remember it and find the correct answer, because you will have the chance to win some additional gems. Sometime during the Easter Event we will ask for the correct answers on our fanpage on Facebook. Three of you with the correct answer will have the chance to win some additional gems. If you can’t find all of the riddles, just ask for help your fellow captains. They will surely help you out.</li> </ul> <li>We know you love to collect treasures so we have more wrecks for you. The Easter Wrecks will appear every 6 hours. Be ready for them!</li> <li>Have you been saving up for a few new ships for your fleet? There are 16 new event ships waiting for you in the shop.

So let’s look at what it brings!<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>Have you already expanded your fleet with new Easter ships? If you are still looking for the right ones, in the shop are 8 new event ships for you to choose from. HMS Blossom, Rurik, Neva, Santa Rosalia, San Lorenzo, Arend, Afrikaansche Galey, and Thienhoven are waiting to join your fleet.</li> <li>The experience needed to achieve higher levels was adjusted to make the overall progress more balanced.

NTX105*#*If you explore the map, you will find a new <b>contractor</b> waiting for you. You might have already heard of him, it’s Christopher Columbus. The famous explorer is embarking on a voyage that will go down in history. Help him and finish his contracts by transporting the materials he needs, and he will reward you. <br/> <br/>After you finish all his contracts he will give you access to a special commodity - <b>cocoa</b>. Cocoa, like other commodities you will encounter on your voyages, can be traded in the <b>Market Town</b>, which is also available on your map. You can exchange the commodity for various materials including experience points. <br/> <br/>Columbus is just the first of many contractors, who will want to trade with you. Look out for them on the map.
NTX106*#*You are an experienced captain now. This means that you are able to explore the <b>shipwrecks</b> which will from now on regularly appear on your map. <br/> <br/>Each day you will find one shipwreck somewhere on your map. Send one of your ships to it and discover the treasure chest hidden inside. You need only a few sailors who will help you recover the sunken treasure. As your level increases so will the content of the chest grow richer, but you will also need more sailors to retrieve it. <br/> <br/>Sometimes you can find special commodities in the wrecks like Barrels of the Bat or Sextants. You can exchange these for gems or other materials in the Market Town. </br> </br>Let’s go hunting, captain!
NTX107*#*Today is a busy day at the port, captain. Seems a few sailors were not careful and lost some cargo in the harbor. The barrels are now floating in the water. Catch them to collect some materials or drunken sailors hidden inside.
NTX108*#*Every dangerous reef needs a lighthouse. Build one on the cliff near your port and you will be able to work on the <b>social contracts</b> and trade with your friends. <br/> <br/>Each day one of your friends (or a random player if you have no or only a few friends) will spot the light from your lighthouse and anchor on the coast near your home port. You will find him/her on the map asking for some materials. After you finish the contract you both will receive a reward (you can get either coins or XP, your friend will receive XP). <br/> <br/>Help your friends in need and you will be helped too. Watch out for the green sign above the lighthouse for XP from other players.
NTX109*#*How is your fleet, captain? Do you have some obsolete ships you wish could be broken up? We have a better use for your old trusty ships. Store them in the <b>Museum</b>! <br/> <br/>You will earn some coins and XP for placing them on display and will learn a thing or two about their history. But be careful, once a ship is in the Museum she cannot be included in your fleet again.<br/> <br/> Only ships that have reached their full potential can be placed in the Museum, that means you need to upgrade them to the fifth star. Also you need to own more ships than your current active fleet capacity.
NTX110*#*One essential building is still missing in your port. <b>The Tavern!</b> This is the place where all the captains gather to enjoy their time on land. <br/> <br/>Each captain has a unique ability which will make your sea trade more profitable. Visit the Tavern and hire the captain you need. Then you can assign him to one of your ships while she is docked. While your ships are in port you can assign and remove the captain from them as you like.<br/> <br/>Each captain can be used only for a limited amount of voyages after which he will return to the Tavern or leave your port for good. New captains will visit your Tavern every day. There are a few extra strong rare captains, so look out for them as they might help you greatly.

NTX187*#*Greetings, captain!<br/> <br/>Fish are biting and fair winds are blowing over the sea. So let’s get over today’s news fast so you can get back to work.<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>New level - Admiral of the Fleet has been added to the achievement Treasure Hunter.</li> <li>New achievements added:<ul> <li>Master of Coin II.</li> <li>Lumberman II.</li> <li>Stonecutter II.</li> <li>Ironmonger II.</li> <li>Angler II.</li> </ul>These achievements follow the completion of all levels of the first instalments of these achievements.</li> <li>The Ship Merchant has a new ship on offer for players on level 250 and higher. If you are one of them, HMS Assistance will visit your port soon.</li> <li>Our crew has also completed two new ships which you can find in the shop. La Couronne and USS America are waiting to join your fleet.</li> </ul> <b>Other:</b> <ul> <li>Are your warehouses full all the time? We decided to help you out a bit and boosted the capacity of the warehouses on all levels. So keep those commodities coming!</li> </ul>
NTX188*#*Look here, captain!<br/> <br/>We hope you had a lot of fun with our Chinese contractors but soon it will be time to say goodbye. The Chinese event is nearing its end. You still have one week to finish the contracts and purchase the event ships. Remember, <b>the event ends on March 6th!</b>
NTX189*#*Hurry up, captain!<br/> <br/>You still have three days to finish the contracts of Zheng He and Ching Shih, buy the Chinese ships, and use up the captains boosting the profit of event commodities. Because <b>on March 6th the Chinese event will come to an end.</b>
NTX190*#*Howdy, captain!<br/> <br/>Have you said your goodbyes to our Chinese guests? However you fared in the last event there is no time to dwell on the past. A new contractor is already getting on board. Say hi to the brave sailor Bobeye. Any similarity to fictional characters is purely accidental.<br/> <br/> <b>Sailor Bobeye Event:</b> <ul> <li>Bobeye is not one of the most accomplished sailors. But that is going to change with a little bit of your help. Bobeye has three parts of contracts for you (20 + 30 + 10). Work hard to get as far as you can.</li> <li>To help Bobeye become a great sailor and get his love Olga, you will need to bring him a few new commodities. Canned Spinach, Barbells, and Pipes can be obtained from the new destinations on your map. There are also a few Spinach Leaves left in the cans floating in your port. Even if you are no lover of spinach, you should still pick those cans up. You don’t want to let your port become a trash pile, right?</li> <li>As we mentioned, Bobeye was not the greatest sailor until now so you can still happen upon some wrecked boats of his. There might still be some useful things left inside.</li> <li>Every sailor needs a great ship. Choose from the 24 new vessels which have appeared in the shop. HMS Gloucester, HMS Hampshire, Lys, Król Dawid, Duquesne, San Telmo, HMS Greenwich, HMS Illustrious, HMY Mary, Marquis Cornwallis, Océan, Redoutable, HMS Windsor Castle, HMS Sans Pareil, RMS Persia, Royal Charter, SS Carnatic, SS Austria, PS Alexandra, PS Vulture, SS City of Boston, SS Oceana, SS Ellengowan, and SS Great Yarmouth are all a dream of any sailor.</li> <li>Sailor Bobeye will appear on the map of each player above level 20. The event will end on April 3rd.</li> </ul>
NTX191*#*Greetings, captain!<br/> <br/>The traditional Tuesday update is here. Today we continue with some additional content for the Bobeye event so have fun and sail on!<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>It’s time to look for Bobeye’s beloved Olga. Bruto has her hidden away somewhere. Uncover the clouds on your map and find Bruto. He will probably want something from you before he releases her. So just indulge him and save Olga. Bobeye will be forever grateful to you.<br/>This time you won’t need to uncover the whole map. So don’t worry when some clouds can’t be removed.</li> <li>The offer of event ships was extended by 6 new beauties. Real Carlos, Sagadahoc, SS Hungarian, SS Deutschland, PS Zealous, and PS Great Western are waiting for you in the shop.</li> </ul>
NTX192*#*Hello there!<br/> <br/>If you are a seasoned captain of Seaport and know your way around the waters of our game, you can go back to your business. Now we will have a few words with our newer recruits.<br/> <br/> Today we start the <b>Exploration Event</b> which is a part of the current main event. So let’s get a look at what this actually means. <ul> <li>From now on new exploration points or outposts will appear on your map. Send your ships there and uncover the clouded areas. You will need to deliver sailors to the exploration point to complete it.</li> <li>Discover a new destination, a shipwreck with treasure, a contractor, or the next exploration point hidden under the cloud.</li> <li>Try to uncover as much area as you can to find many valuable rewards.</li> <li>The Exploration Event will end with the main event. The clouds will return to cover the area you explored so you can sail out on a voyage of discovery during some next event again. But all the rewards you collected will be yours.</li> </ul>All clear, captain? So let’s set the course for the unexplored seas!
NTX193*#*Ahoy, captain!<br/> <br/>Have you saved Olga already? If not, you better hurry up. Bobeye is waiting for his beloved impatiently. So quickly read today’s news and let’s get back to the search!<br/> <br/> <b>The Gift of Spinach:</b> <ul> <li>The spinach has given you a super power too! <b>Now you can finish all your social contracts with just one ship.</b> Use your great strength to help your friends and keep on trading! However, the power of spinach will last only until the end of the event on April 3rd. And it also applies only to NEW social contracts which will appear after the update. So trade with your fellow captains and enjoy the rewards together.</li> </ul> <b>Content</b> <ul> <li>On Thursday use your chance to buy the Sailor’s Chest. The insides are full of useful materials, captains, and possibly even the shiny green gems.</li> <li>Today we expand the permanent shop offer with two new ships. Dryade and Comm de Marseille are ready to join your fleet.</li> </ul>
NTX194*#*Hello, captain!<br/> <br/>It’s Tuesday and the time for the traditional Seaport update. So let’s not dawdle and let’s get to business right away!<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>From today you can upgrade the Town Hall to level 37 (from player level 280).</li> <li>The Ship Merchant has a new ship on offer. HMS Dartmouth will visit the ports of players from level 255.</li> <li>The shop offer is also extended by two new ships. Saint-Esprit and Juan Nepomuceno are the newest beauties available to higher level players.</li> </ul>Here is a quick reminder, captain! Don’t forget to work on Bobeye’s contracts and save poor Olga from Bruto. <b>There is only one week left before the current event ends.</b> The event offer in the shop, event captains, destinations, and contractors will leave Seaport on April 3rd. The social contracts will also return to their previous difficulty and you will need more ships to complete them. So hurry up, captain!
NTX195*#*Happy Easter, captain!<br/> <br/>Enjoy the holidays and use the free time to finish the Bobeye Event. There are only three days left until we must say goodbye to Bobeye and Bruto. Make sure you<b> finish their contracts until April 3rd</b>. If there is an event ship you want to own, buy it before the event ends. The part of the map you explored during the event will get covered by clouds again, so pick up all the treasures you found there. And then get ready for something big!
NTX196*#*Greetings, captain!<br/> <br/>Today’s update is going to be huge. Let’s start with the new event which all of you will be able to enjoy fully.<br/> <br/> <b>Titanic Event:</b> <ul> <li> The most famous ship of all time is arriving in Seaport. Let’s find out what was the real story behind this great tragedy. We will start with constructing the enormous ship with the ship designer <b>Thomas Andrews</b> in his first 30 contracts. Then we board the ship for her fateful maiden voyage with the first-class passenger <b>Molly Brown</b> in the next 30 contracts. And after the tragedy, we will help the captain of Carpathia <b>Arthur Rostron</b> save all the survivors in his final 20 contracts.</li> <li> <b>From now on all the event contracts are going to be set according to your player level.</b> That means that the required materials are the same for everyone but the amount you need to deliver will depend on your current player level. So if you work hard, you should be able to finish the whole event. Of course, the difficulty will rise with each contract, so expect to work a little sweat in the final stages.</li> <li>To finish the contracts and buy the event ships you will need these new commodities: Ships Screw, Silver Cutlery, and Lifebuoy. You can get them from the new destinations on your map. If you are going to smash the icebergs floating in your harbor, you may also find the Flares. You don’t need them for anything specific so just sell them in the Market Town.</li> <li>Sinking ships with treasure will appear on your map. Send your ship there and find the precious materials.</li> <li>Expand your fleet and choose from the 22 new event ships in the shop. RMS Tayleur, Blue Jacket, Madagascar, Water Witch, HMS Coventry, HMS Chester, Seven Oaks, Industrious Bee, Clove Tree, RMS Carpathia, SS Mount Temple, SS Frankfurt, RMS Olympic, SS Californian, CS Mackay-Bennett, Montmagny, Algerine, Ionic, SS Tropic, SS Adriatic, RMS Cedric, and SS Runic are going to withstand any iceberg.</li> <li>The Titanic event is available for all players from level 20. The voyage of the RMS Titanic will last until <b>May 15th</b>.</li> <li>You might have noticed that the great ship itself is not in the shop. Don’t worry, you will all have the chance to obtain Titanic soon. The event has only just begun.</li> </ul>There is more, captain! Check out our new permanent features in the second newsletter.
NTX197*#*Hello, captain!<br/> <br/>Apart from the Titanic Event we also have two new permanent features for you. So let’s have a look! <br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li> As you might have already noticed a new stat has been added to the ship description - <b>the Fleet Slots</b>. Today we start using it for real. The Fleet Slot number will tell you how many free slots you need in your fleet to actively use this ship. It also reflects the capacity and price.<ul> <li>For example, ships with 2 slots will have 2 times the capacity of a ship with 1 slot on the same player level.</li> <li>Basically, all the sailing ships will take up 1 slot in your fleet, the steamships will take up 2, and so on.</li> <li>All the steamships that you can find in the shop are now adjusted accordingly. Their capacity, price, and slots have been increased. However, all the ships you have purchased before, stay the way they were when you bought them.</li> <li>This way you can manage your fleet easier by limiting the number of ships in your active fleet and also save some sailors as the price of the voyage remains the same.</li> </ul> <li>The <b>Captain’s Tasklist</b> is a feature our newer players already know. From today all of you will find the list icon in the bottom right corner of your port. There are three tasks you need to complete before you receive the reward. A new tasklist will be available each day. The tasks will get more difficult as your progress in the game.</li> <li>We have noticed that you enjoy the social contracts much more now that they can be completed with one ship. So we decided to prolong this feature by one more week. Enjoy the trading, captain!</ul>
NTX198*#*Ahoy, captain!<br/> <br/>After the last mega update let’s have a calmer Tuesday today. But we still have some news for you. So let’s have a look, shall we?<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>Our crew has finished two new ships. PS Hibernia and Borrowdale are waiting for you in the shop.</li> </ul> <b>Other:</b> <ul> <li>We can see that you all enjoy the new social contracts much more than before. So we decided to make this change permanent! Finish all the social contract with just one ship and focus your fleet on other important tasks.</li> <li>some bugs fixed - freeze on loading screen, displaying of error notice</li> </ul>
NTX199*#*Hello, captain!<br/> <br/>At last, the winter ice has melted and we can get back to the seas. So raise the anchor, captain, and venture on your next voyage! But first, don't forget to take the spring gift from our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Seaportgame/photos/p.936034033225330/936034033225330/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">Fanpage</a>. The free anchors can be traded for useful materials in the Market Town.
NTX200*#*Aye aye, captain!<br/> <br/>We have seen that some of you have already finished the Titanic contracts. We can’t have you getting bored now, can we? So let’s start exploring now!<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>The Titanic exploration event is starting! Send your ships across the map and discover the unknown. There are many new destinations, treasures, and contractors waiting for you under the clouds. So don’t keep them waiting. There are three courses available for players over level 20, 40, and 70. Each one is a bit more difficult but also more rewarding. The amount of sailors required to clear a part of the map is depending on your player level.</li> <li>The second Titanic Chest will be available on Thursday. Look out for the green ship delivering it to your port. This time, you can grab one chest for FREE! Enjoy your rewards, captain!</li> <li>The offer of event ships in the shop was expanded too. HMS Advice, Green Jacket, Red Jacket, SS Asiatic, SS Birma, SS Nomadic, SS Maasdam, and CS Minia can be yours for a fair price.</li> </ul>
NTX201*#*From now on you can expand your fleet by steamships. These vessels have some distinctive features setting them apart from the sailing ships. So let’s have a look!<br/> <br/>Steamships will take up two slots in your active fleet.<ul> <li>Ships with 2 slots (steamship) will have 2 times the capacity of a ship with 1 slot (sailing ship) on the same player level. But you will need two free slots in your fleet to use them.</li> <li>The price of these ships is also higher but the sail cost remains the same according to the selected destination.</li> <li>The Fleet Slot system will help you manage your fleet easier and faster by limiting the number of ships in your active fleet while expanding your overall capacity. You will also save some sailors as the price of the voyage remains the same for each ship.</li> <li>This system will also apply to the more modern ships like tankers and cruise ships which will come later. Each will have a larger fleet slot number and a higher capacity.</li> </ul>Steamships require Mechanical Parts for upgrades.<ul> <li>You can produce the Mechanical Parts in a new building in your port. You can build the Workshop if you have your Town Hall on level 12 (from player level 88). To produce the Mechanical Parts you will need fish and iron.</li> <li>From now on you can meet contractors from the Steam Era in Seaport. The first of them is John Fitch - the inventor of the first steamboat. These contractors will also require the Mechanical parts in some of their contracts.</li> </ul>All clear, captain? So let’s get back to the rudder!
NTX202*#*Hello, captain!<br/> <br/>Our crew has worked hard to finish another batch of fresh updates for your port. So let’s have a look at the details!<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>Let’s welcome a new permanent contractor in Seaport! We have asked you on our Fanpage who you want to meet next. And the winner is… the Dutch merchant from New Amsterdam, <b>Margaret Hardenbroeck</b>. Help her with the business and learn a bit about the hardships of being a businesswoman in the 17th century in her 40 contracts. You can work with Margaret if you have already reached level 185 and finished the contracts of Samuel Champlain.</li> <li>The Town Hall can be upgraded to level 38 (available from player level 296).</li> <li>The Ship Merchant will offer a new ship to all the players above level 260. Check out the beautiful Maidstone and make her yours.</li> <li>Two new ships have been added to the shop too. The fresh newcomers are SS Ben-my-Chree and SS City of Glasgow.</li> <li>New player levels 501-520 available.</li> </ul>
NTX203*#*Greetings, captain!<br/> <br/>At last, you will get the chance to obtain the most famous ship in history. And to not disappoint anyone, you will all get her! Or no one. But let’s hope it won’t come to that. <br/> <br/> <b>Global Quest:</b> <ul> <li>It’s time to build Titanic! This enormous ship will require the efforts of all Seaport players. Work hard and construct this magnificent vessel so you can all add her to your fleet. To obtain Titanic you must complete the Global Quest until the end of the Titanic Event on May 15th.</li> </ul> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>We know you yearn for the great Titanic but perhaps you will spare a look for our two new ships in the shop too. SS Laura and San Ildefonso can be yours for a fair price.</li> <li>The following destinations have new levels:<ul> <li>Small Town,</li> <li>Coastline,</li> <li>Gulf,</li> <li>Neighborhood,</li> <li>Rubble,</li> <li>Forest,</li> <li>Bamboo,</li> <li>Blacksmith,</li> <li>Rocky Mill,</li> <li>Riviera,</li> <li>Iron Mill, and</li> <li>Cave.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
NTX204*#*Ahoy, captain!<br/> <br/>Do you know what the Global Quest is? If not, sit down with us for a minute and we will tell you all you need to know.<br/> <br/>Global Quest is basically a global contractor (without the gentleman or madam on the picture) requiring the work of all the Seaport players to get completed. <ul> <li>Each contract you or any other player completes will get counted towards the overall progress.</li> <li>There are several milestone rewards and the final reward which all players will receive regardless of how many contracts they had finished.</li> <li>However, the ones that do not work on the contracts lose the chance to obtain many partial rewards including the occasional gems.</li> </ul>So work hard, cooperate, and get your rewards. And do not resent the players who did not participate as much as you did. They might have some other things keeping them busy. Have fun and sail on, captain!
NTX205*#*Ahoy, captain!</br> </br>Last week we worked hard on new ships for your fleet. Let’s look at the beauties which have sailed into Seaport today.<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>Today we add 6 new ships to the permanent shop offer. Take a look at SS City of Berlin, SS George W. Elder, SS Bokhara, SS King Orry, HMS Phaeton, and Républic Française.</li> <li>The Ship Merchant has a new ship on offer too. Newcastle will show up in your port after you reach level 265.</li> </ul>
NTX206*#*Attention, captain!<br/> <br/>The Titanic Event is nearing its end. We hope you enjoyed this enormous event and finished most of the tasks.

If you meet his criteria, he will show up on your map and give you his 50 contracts. Should you not be experienced enough, don’t despair! James Cook is the new permanent resident of Seaport and he will wait for you until you can meet him. Whenever that shall be.</li> <li>To work with Captain Cook you will need a great fleet. Consider improving it with these two new ships. Incorruptible and PS Lady Tyler are the beauties which can now be yours.</li> <li>The Ship Merchant is also thinking about his customers. He has prepared the HMS Halifax for players above level 280.</li> <li>You will have the chance to buy the last Darwin’s Chest on Thursday. This time, you can find among the usual rewards also some magnificent ships. So try your luck, captain!</li> </ul>
NTX221*#*Just a second, captain! <br/> <br/> We don’t want to to keep you from your business too long. Just remember, you have only one week to finish the current event. Darwin and his lovely wife Emma are departing Seaport on <b>July 10th</b>.
NTX222*#*Time is running, captain!</br> </br>There are only three days left until the end of the event. We will have to say goodbye to Charles and Emma. The event ships will also leave the shop. So mark the <b>July 10th</b> in your calendar.
NTX223*#*Hello again, captain!</br> </br>In addition to the new events we always strive to improve your beloved Seaport. So today we bring you these exciting updates!<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li> <b>New Captains</b> - Captains underwent a special training so they can offer you better services. Read on to find out what’s new! <ul> <li>When you visit the Tavern now, you can notice that each captain is marked by a color. The color signifies his experience and power. The old sea wolves who can offer you the best services are marked by <i>orange</i>. Following are the <i>violet</i> captains, then the <i>blue</i> ones, the <i>green</i>, and <i>white</i> are the newbies with the weakest skills.</li> <li>The power and price of the captains now depend on your current player level. The captains are randomly generated each day. You can find all of them even the strongest ones available not only for gems but also for coins.</li> <li> Captains which decreased the sailor price of a destination were transformed into captains increasing the sailor capacity of the ship (including the ones you have already hired).</li> <li>The useless captains providing a bonus for old event commodities were automatically dismissed. Don’t worry, you received the same amount of experience points for them as if you would have sold them one by one.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Are you tired of looking at your old port? If so, we have good news for you. We have hired new construction workers who will make a masterpiece out of the buildings in your port. Just upgrade the building and you will see the new design. In time we will also change the design of the Lighthouse and Tavern. We hope you will like the new look of your port.</li> <li>Town Hall can be now upgraded to level 40 (available from player level  312).</li> <li>New player levels 561-580 were added. </li> </ul>

NTX260*#*Ho ho ho, captain!</br> </br>Christmas is here! Well, there is still a month until the real holiday comes but the Christmas Event in Seaport is starting now. So let’s have a look at the details!<br/> <br/> <b>The Christmas Quest:</b> <ul> <li>The little <b>Eva</b> really needs your help. Go meet her and buy the matches she will offer you. It’s really important. Help her with the 10 contracts and you will receive the special <b>Christmas ship, Snowball</b>. According to your level, it can be a sailing ship, a steamer or a motor ship.</li> <li>After completing Eva’s contracts the exploration of your map will be available. Send your ships out to the sea and find the locations with our two heroines. <b>Eva and Clara Barton</b> are traveling to America, each with her own quest. Eva hopes to find her family and Clara is going to establish a Red Cross branch in the United States. Choose which one you want to help and you will receive tokens to upgrade the ship Snowball. There will be 9 choices where you can decide to help Eva or Clara and to receive Capacity or Crew Token. But remember! You can choose only one path.</li> <li>The beautiful Christmas ships are available in the shop. Tromp, HMS Morning Star, Snow, HMG Comet, HMS Olive Branch, HMS Grampus, HMS Pyramus, HMS Icicle, HMS Cheerful, HMS North Star, USS Red Rover, HMS Endymion, USS Home, HMS Pique, AHS Centaur, RFA Maine, MS Vanganella, HMHS Mauretania, HMS Snowflake, USS Mercy, Ramb IV, SS Letitia, and USCGC Northwind are ready for the Christmas voyage.</li> <li>The Christmas Event is available from player level 20 and will end on <b>January 15, 2019</b>.</li> <li>We have a long voyage yet before us and there will be many more adventures during the Christmas. So stay with your fleet, captain!</li> </ul>
NTX261*#*Aye aye, captain!<br/> <br/>We started off our Christmas event untraditionally the last Friday. But the Tuesday updates are staying. So here we are with a bunch of new upgrades for your port.<br/> <br/> <b>Content:</b> <ul> <li>The <b>Global Quest</b> is starting today. The nurse Clara, who you can meet during the Christmas event, is organizing a charity. All players of Seaport can help her collect various presents and materials. Visit the Christmas Tree and deliver whatever materials are needed. You will receive generous presents too, but remember, the more contracts you complete, the more gems will be waiting for you in the final reward.</li> <li>The numbers of Motor ships in the shop are growing. Sydney Lasry, Mauri, Cincinnati, and Tippecanoe are ready to start their engines. </li> </ul> <b>Other:</b> <ul> <li>Have you purchased any Motor ships from the Birthday Event? And do you have no more Peanut Oil for the upgrades? Don’t worry, from now on you can upgrade them with Oil just like all the other Motor Ships.</li> <li>Some additional balancing adjustments were done according to the feedback we received from all of you - capacity of certain ships was updated, destination Cement Factory has a lower crew requirement, and some others.</li> <li>Rebalance of Mechanical Parts - requirements for Mechanical Parts were lowered to 1/10th of the original quantity. You will produce a smaller amount of Mechanical Parts but also need less of them to purchase or upgrade ships. This will help you manage your warehouse capacity easier. The achievement Mechanic has been adjusted accordingly.</li> </ul>

SCRT015*#*Winter is here
SCRT016*#*Into the harbor
SCRT017*#*The big city
SCRT018*#*The last choice
SCRX001*#*One fine evening you spot two ships in front of you. It seems one is chasing the other. Depending on the course you set, you can reach one of the vessels.
SCRX002*#*Thanks to your superior experience on the sea you can still approach one of the vessels without the other taking note. Aren’t you curious about the passenger on the second ship?
SCRX003*#*You can feel that both rivals could help you in your mission, finding Jonathan Harker. It’s your choice who you will help in the hopes that he will lead you to him faster, or for other reasons.
SCRX004*#*Something sinister awaits the hunter. Will you help him stand through it or do you join the Count and his dark machinations?
SCRX005*#*Neither of them is giving up even though the voyage is full of troubles for both. Keep your loyalty to your chosen one or help the other side. In the end, everyone is for himself in this quest.
SCRX006*#*The ships of the rivals are nearing each other. This may be the final fight. Now choose wisely, captain. For it may mean the end for one of the adversaries.
SCRX007*#*These men, human or not, are tough. They won’t go down so easily. So the quest continues. And your hard choice remains.
SCRX008*#*You did not forget your mission, right? The rivals are nearing their final destination. But you can still save Jonathan.
SCRX009*#*You reached London. Everything may be lost or won. Depending on your chosen side.
SCRX010*#*It’s time to get ready for the voyage across the Atlantic. While preparing to board your ship you meet a young nurse, Clara Barton. She needs your help too but will you leave little Eva alone?
SCRX011*#*It’s time to heat the engines and go. However, there are still some last issues to solve. Will you assist Eva or Clara?
SCRX012*#*At last, you are all aboard and heading for New York. Clara is going to tell you about her big plans and Eva is enjoying her first voyage. So who will you join now?
SCRX013*#*Christmas is getting closer and it can be felt on your ship too. Help one of the girls enjoy a pleasant pre-Christmas time. Eva and Clara are waiting for you.
SCRX014*#*It’s time to think about the future. Eva hopes you will help her find her parents. But Clara worries about her. Which lady will you join this time?
SCRX015*#*It’s cold and the snow is falling on your ship. It’s time to get ready for the winter. Clara is thinking about the Red Cross and Eva about her parents. They both need your help. But the choice is yours.
SCRX016*#*America is close and so is the end of their voyage. Clara and Eva are both getting ready for the ship’s arrival in New York. Choose the one you want to visit this time.
SCRX017*#*The girls are in New York and each go their own way. But which way will you choose?
SCRX018*#*Christmas is almost here but how are Eva and Clara faring? Will there be a happy ending for the two heroines? Make your choice and find out.

SPCE005*#*That's all partner! I'm really surprised you managed to fulfill all assigned tasks. I grant you access to my stock of rare commodity as a token of my gratitude.
SPCE006*#*Well done! I had a good feeling about you right from the start. As a reward for completing all my requests I will give to you these beautiful green gems. Use them wisely.
SPCE007*#*Well done, me hearty! Ye have finished all me contracts and become a fine pirate. Take this precious skull as a parting gift. Ye can trade it in the market for a reward ye like. Choose well!
SPCE008*#*Thank you, captain! You have finished all my contracts to my satisfaction. For your wonderful service I grant you access to a rare commodity - the grape vine.
SPCE009*#*Well done! Thanks to you we have discovered new territories for our people. Take this chest as a sign of my gratitude. You can trade it in the market for a reward you like.
SPCE010*#*That's all partner! I'm really surprised you managed to fulfill all assigned tasks. As a token of my gratitude I give you my precious silver chests! Trade them well.
SPCE011*#*Thank you, my friend! You have finished all my contracts splendidly. Now take these compasses and may they always show you the right path. You can trade them in the market for a reward you like.
SPCE012*#*Well done! You have once again proved what a great sailor you are. I could not have managed it without you. And for that I give you these precious sextants. Don't forget to sell them on the market.
SPCE013*#*I am thankful for your help but I need to leave now. I know you can appreciate a good rum just like me, so take these rum barrels. If you don't drink them up you can get a nice sum for them at the market.
SPCE014*#*We could not have succeeded without your help. So take these barrels of the rum we made together and trade them on the market for a prize of your choice.
SPCE015*#*I must sail on but you have assisted me well so I have a reward for you. I can't spare any of my treasures but take these pretty seashells. Maybe you will be able to sell them at the market.
SPCE016*#*You expect a reward? Again? Greedy like all humans, aren't you? Fine, take these starfish. This is what became of the lost souls from before our time. You may be able sell them as a ghostly curiosity.
SPCE017*#*You helped me break the curse. I have nothing to give you but the Souls of the Sea but by now you should know they aren't worthless. Take them with my thanks. And now I must go to meet my love at the bottom of the ocean.
SPCE018*#*Your help was a significant part of our success. For that I give you the fruit of our effort. I am sure there will be a lot of better steamships in the future, but this one is the milestone in the steamship history. So treasure it well.
SPCE019*#*You helped me with all my curious requests, so I have something special for you. I found these warm socks at a flea market, the seller said they belonged to Father Christmas. For real!
SPCE020*#*We have made it to a happy end together. For staying with me through this hard winter time, I give you these beautiful Golden Bells. They are a perfect decoration for a Christmas tree.
SPCE021*#*I would have given you my book, but I think you will find my friend more useful. I met him in the Tavern, he is an experienced captain, and can serve on one of your ships. I am sure his skills will come in handy.
SPCE022*#*Thank you, you are a savior! Take one of my men with you, we had a little disagreement, so he wants to leave. But he is a skilled captain, I am sure he will be helpful to you.
SPCE023*#*We go separate ways now, but I will give you an advice. If you are looking for treasure, you should head west. But these are rich waters here, you can find useful resources all around.
SPCE024*#*Now don’t look so unhappy, matey. It’s what all pirates do. Here take me sword, it should be useful. Ye can try to rob the fool to the south-west. I stole his crates, but they were empty.
SPCE025*#*Now the cloth will get undamaged to the buyer. If you want more money, I heard the pirate talking about a treasure to the north. But you will have to go around, the water currents are too strong here.
SPCE026*#*You won’t be regretting this choice. They are good and reliable men. You can count on every one of them.
SPCE027*#*Thank you for helping my men, captain. They would like to join you on your voyage, and so repay you for saving them.
SPCE028*#*Food! At last! Take these volcanic rocks, they are an interesting curiosity. But, unfortunately, like all other rocks, they can’t be eaten.
SPCE029*#*So you are looking for a treasure, you say? I am afraid, I heard nothing about it. Here is your part of the iron, and good luck on your quest. I am sure, you will find what you are looking for.
SPCE030*#*That is a very beautiful stone. It will look great under the feet of the dancing guests.
SPCE031*#*The barrels are filled with rum already. There is some wood left, it would be wasteful to just leave it to rot. Take it, it is well-suited for shipbuilding, too.
SPCE032*#*Thank you! You saved me from a cruel fate. I assure you, I am a competent navigator, just out of luck recently. Let’s embark for the brighter tomorrow together.
SPCE033*#*Look at this unfortunate pal. He tried to sail through the passage, but his ship hit the rocks and sunk. He is a seasoned captain. Take him with you, he seems unhappy just sitting here.
SPCE034*#*So firstly, you need to know where to get your resources. For example, there is an iron mine to the west. And second, you need to have able and trustworthy people with you, like my friend here.
SPCE035*#*Well, it’s sweet only after you add sugar. But the cocoa bean is full of energy even without it. So, while you are munching on it, listen. Go to the east, and the fortune will smile upon you.
SPCE036*#*Since you have helped me, I will give you some advice. To the east from here is something precious, but strong eastern wind won’t let you continue straight. You have to go from the south.
SPCE037*#*Listen! If you are looking to get rich, look for the snow. The ice hides many riches. But be careful, if your ship gets stuck in an iceberg, you may freeze there to death.
SPCE038*#*Perfect! You could not have found better sails anywhere else. Now you can sail to the horizon and beyond.
SPCE039*#*The farther north you go, the more fish you can find. I always go fishing near the edge of the iceberg. The sea there is just overflowing with the silvery fish.
SPCE040*#*The chests are quite light. For yer own good, I hope they arrr not empty. Take yer new crew, and be off, before I decide not to trust ye.
SPCE041*#*Quiet reading is nice, but I miss the excitement of discovery. Now that my home and family is safe, let me join you on your explorations.
SPCE042*#*Ye built this nice grave for me bird, so I will tell ye somethin’. I’ve had quite a catch on the last raid. Couldn’t take it all, so I had to bury it. Ye will find it to the south, but ye must take a little detour.
SPCE043*#*You have saved us. Thank you. Take my men with you, they will gladly serve on your ship until you bring them to the nearest port. I will take the next ship.
SPCE044*#*The army is almost done. You can take the stone I did not use. There is a large stone quarry to the south should you need more of it.
SPCE045*#*Now let’s venture forth! Together we will surely find the fabled treasure. Don’t forget to ask anyone we meet about it, they can point us in the right direction.
SPCE046*#*I hope the payment is sufficient. I have also heard the natives speak about a place to the east, where they hide their treasures. It’s probably not worth much, but you should still look it up.
SPCE047*#*The wine made it clear, you are a good person. So let me join you on your voyage. My experience will be valuable, and I would only get stabbed here by some angry local.
SPCE048*#*I will make sure to send you a bottle of my finest rum, once the distillery is finished. For now you can take the stone from the quarry, it’s a good construction material.
SPCE049*#*I heard some fool is lookin’ for me treasure. Is it ye? Well, it’s to the south from ‘ere, but ye won’t get thar so easily through the barricade I made.
SPCE050*#*Take the sailors with you, and leave. You want to know about treasure? Be glad I did not pull you into the deep. But I may yet change my mind. Be gone now!
SPCE051*#*With the stone you gave me, I will finish the bridge in no time. But if you want to explore the southern island right now, you will have to approach it from the east.
SPCE052*#*It was good working with you, my friend. As a parting gift take my favorite ship with you. It's the ship on which I sailed to New France for the first time, the beautiful Bonne Renommée.
SPCE053*#*You have helped me, friend. I would give you something precious, but we have little valuables here. So take the roses. They are beautiful and grow all around our settlement.
SPCE054*#*I thank you with all my heart for everything you did for me. Please take these totems of our clan. They will protect you from danger.
SPCE055*#*I love the Easter time. We always make lots of colored eggs with my family. I have taught this relaxing activity my crew too. Take some of the eggs, I have full cabin of them.
SPCE056*#*I have found these colored eggs on the island. They are a bit of mystery. Are they natural or made by the natives? Or by someone else?
SPCE057*#*Thank you for your assistance, captain. Now we all can enjoy Easter in peace. Take the rest of my colored eggs, I know you have a use for them.
SPCE058*#*Thank you for your help, captain. Let’s keep on exploring, there are many discoveries waiting for us.
SPCE059*#*The chest is open, I hope you are content with your share of the treasure. I will also lend you one of my seasoned sailors. She will help you on your expedition.
SPCE060*#*FINAL REWARD
SPCE061*#*Thank you for your cooperation.
SPCE062*#*Thank you, captain! It was a pleasure working with you. As a token of my gratitude, I give you my favorite ship.
SPCE063*#*You have earned my trust and recognition. Accept these eagles, the standard of the Roman legions, as a sign of my gratitude. You are a true Roman, my friend.
SPCE064*#*I am pleased by the results of our cooperation. And when I am satisfied, I can be very generous. These precious amphorae are for you. Enjoy your prize, captain.
SPCE065*#*You have proven to be a trustworthy business partner. Take all my treasures, I won't need them anymore. Goodbye, captain.
SPCE066*#*You helped me bring peace to Rome and for this I am truly grateful. Caesar would be proud of you too. These golden eagles are for you.
SPCE067*#*Good job, captain. I will return, but until then, take care. Take these Japanese coins we received from the villagers. You deserve them for all the work you have done. You can trade them for something useful on the market.
SPCE068*#*You have shown me that it is time for Japan to open up to the world. Thank you, captain. You have earned your reward.
SPCE069*#*The mission was successful thanks to you. And here is your reward. The Japanese gold coins koban will earn you a fine price at the market. Enjoy your prize, captain!
SPCE070*#*The wedding turned out better than I expected. Now it's time we part ways, captain. But don't forget to take these Japanese coins with you. They are valuable.
SPCE071*#*It was a pleasure working with you, captain. I will leave my second ship, the Great Britain, in your care. I know she will be in good hands with you.
SPCE072*#*We have had some fun together. Here, matey! This's a farewell gift for ye. We might meet again, but until then, take care. There is a lot of dangerous pirates here.
SPCE073*#*Wait! Take these black pearls with ye. They are incredibly valuable. I would hate it if the English got their hands on them. Goodbye, captain.
SPCE074*#*You have helped me even after I wanted to rob you. Take these pearls. You deserve them. Farewell, captain!
SPCE075*#*Ah, get out of me face. I don’t have time to chat with ye. I need to plan me return to Nassau and get rid of the girls playing at pirates.
SPCE076*#*I can't help but feel I will regret I let that creature escape. Anyway, take these watches. I have found them while... working. And thank you for everything.
SPCE077*#*I have a bride thanks to you. Here, take these mechanical hearts. They did not work in the end but the craftsmanship is still impressive.
SPCE078*#*Goodbye, captain. You were one of the better humans I knew.
SPCE079*#*This is the end, captain. I know the monster is here. Just be careful.
SPCE080*#*I had a great time at your port, captain. Keep up the good work and you will soon be the master of the greatest fleet of all seas. Farewell, captain, and enjoy this small gift.
SPCE081*#*I must hurry back to the ships right after we learn what we need. But you should stay here longer and get to know what you can. Here are some lanterns should you seek your way back to the ships without me.
SPCE082*#*I will leave you with the Elder now. But thank you for your help, captain. And here, take these shiny stars, they will give you a bit of light in this cold and dark Arctic winter.
SPCE083*#*So happy Quviasukvik and Merry Christmas, captain! Take this last present from me and enjoy the rest of the winter.
SPCE084*#*It’s good to meet a kind captain in these icy waters. You have your reward for helping me but I have a present for you too. Merry Christmas, captain!
SPCE085*#*Fair winds on your way home, captain. Take these few eggs with you. Their parents have abandoned them. That happens sometimes. Find them a place in a nice penguin habitat.
SPCE086*#*Your help was invaluable, captain. I don't know how to thank you but take these precious stones at least. And now let's get inside a warm inn!
SPCE087*#*Here is a little something to motivate you. There are more treasures waiting for you if you complete your assignment.
SPCE088*#*In case we don’t meet again, take this. Think of it as your retirement money. You are a wonderful pirate. Goodbye, captain!
SPCE089*#*You are clever as a fox, captain. I can’t help but feel you have outsmarted me. But you have solved the pirate problem so here, you deserve this.
SPCE090*#*I yam so grateful. Here, take these caps. Ya are not just any sailor, ya are a true capt'n.
SPCE091*#*Thank's again, capt'n. I have these wonderful wheels for ya. They broke off when I tried to steer th' ships. I must have had too much spinach. This sailin' business is tough.
SPCE092*#*And here we have our happy end! Take care of yaself and yer ships, capt'n. Better than I. Don't break things off. And find a use for these poor rudders.
SPCE093*#*Ha! Fooled ya! Take this useless stuff, ya fool. That’s all ya gonna get.
SPCE094*#*This time I am gonna eat it and punch Bobeye into the next week. And Olga stays with me!
SPCE095*#*Here, take her. But don’t think she will stay with that moron for long. She loves me!
SPCE096*#*I don’t think spinach is enough to give up the girl. Ya should come up with something better next time.
SPCE097*#*Yes, yes. I took Olga. Here she is. Ya can be the savior today.
SPCE098*#*Take Olga with ya. She was just distracting me anyway. And now go! I must prepare for the final fight.
SPCE099*#*Don’t you just feel proud when you gaze upon that large beauty? Let’s get aboard, captain. And don’t forget the tickets for you and your friends.
SPCE100*#*This was a great tragedy but it’s wonderful to see people are still willing to help each other. You and Mrs. Brown are the true heroes.
SPCE101*#*We have saved many lives together, captain. It’s sad we could not save them all. Here, take these jewels to remember how brave you were during this terrible tragedy.
SPCE102*#*That's done. Now let's move on. I believe you have still seas to explore.
SPCE103*#*It was good doing business with you, captain. Here is a small farewell gift from me. Hope you will enjoy it.
SPCE104*#*It was a pleasure, captain. I know you are busy but if you find some time, read my books. I have a few signed copies for you. You can give some of them to your friends too.
SPCE105*#*Here, this is for you. For all the trouble. And now let's hurry onwards!
SPCE106*#*That has been a voyage you experience once in a lifetime. It was great we could do it together. Fair winds on your next voyages, captain.
SPCE107*#*Come here for a second, captain. This young man has come to me with a request to help him learn how to be a captain. I think you are better suited to this task and you can both benefit from mutual cooperation.
SPCE108*#*This has been a voyage that changed my life and it's also thanks to you. I want to share with you my Fieldnotes. I think you can gain from them a lot.
SPCE109*#*If you are not free to captain the Beagle again, I have one eager volunteer. I am sure you can find some work for him.
SPCE110*#*I have found the books I have put aside for you. Charles finished them only recently. If you are a fan of nature and history, you will surely enjoy them.
SPCE111*#*Take care of my ship until I return. When I am back with our boat, we will sail off right away.
SPCE112*#*Here is something for your help. And good luck on your travels, captain!
SPCE113*#*My thanks, captain. Here is something for your trouble. Now you can go ahead, I will be with you shortly.
SPCE114*#*I don’t want you to remember me only as the beautiful but malicious witch. Here, take these gifts. I can be grateful too. Odysseus is already waiting for you on the ship. Fair winds, captain.
SPCE115*#*Good job! Now take a break and welcome a new member of your crew. She can help you greatly with your future endeavors.
SPCE116*#*Good job! Now take a break and welcome a new member of your crew. He can help you greatly with your future endeavors.
SPCE117*#*I see you like those shiny little gems. Here, this is a bonus for a job well done.
SPCE118*#*Circe gave me these tridents, said they are blessed by Poseidon. But I prefer a sword to fight my battles. So you take them.
SPCE119*#*Some people think that a woman can’t be a good captain. But I know better. Get to know my friend here, she is an excellent captain.
SPCE120*#*There is no place as beautiful as home. Thank you for your help getting back and accept the Bows of Apollo from me. There are only a few treasures as precious as this.
SPCE121*#*It was a tough job but I am grateful to you anyway. I have made something special for you. These are not just ordinary suspenders. They are improved!
SPCE122*#*When I was looking for a job I befriended this pal. He is a really good sailor, at least so he says. Maybe you could find a job for him.
SPCE123*#*I have a friend and she wants to become a captain too. Maybe you could let her join your crew.
SPCE124*#*So that's it. Take care, captain. And please, take these cards. I can't stand gambling on the ship. Yet I again found some cards in my husband's office.
SPCE125*#*Congratulations! You are officially a great fisherman. Now enjoy your well-earned reward.
SPCE126*#*Oh, look! I caught some crabs in my fishing net. If you know how to get the tasty meat from the shell, they are a fine delicacy.
SPCE127*#*Sometimes you can catch a beautiful lady into the net too. She can be a wicked mermaid or just a drowning maiden. And rarely even a capable captain.
SPCE128*#*The Legendary Tuna! How beautiful he is! And he is all yours now.
SPCE129*#*Please find Jonathan. I hope he is well but even if not, I must know the truth. This is for you, just find him for me.
SPCE130*#*I have this one troublesome sailor on my ship who can't follow orders. But I am sure you can manage her.
SPCE131*#*If you help me, it will be worth your while. I will lend you one of my sailors, a very capable fellow. Don't worry, he won't bite.
SPCE132*#*And take a few garlic heads with you. Eat it, put it in your pockets, place it under your pillow. That demon hates the smell of it.
SPCE133*#*I have lots of riches back in my castle. These rings are just a taste. The treasures can be yours if you continue to help me.
SPCE134*#*Maybe we should leave one of our own guarding the docks too. I know about someone for that job.
SPCE135*#*One of the pirates would like to join my crew. But I have no need for her. Maybe you can use another sailor on your ship.
SPCE136*#*Take these, in case there are some vampirates among the attackers. If we survive this, I will make you the best garlic soup you ever ate.
SPCE137*#*Our cooperation is going really well. So here is your reward.
SPCE138*#*This lass here is a true vampire fighter. If you venture out there, take her with you. She will protect you.
SPCE139*#*Aren't you lonely sometimes, captain? How about some fine company? You can never guess how skilled this one is.
SPCE140*#*I have captured one of the pirates. She said she wants to join us. But I don't trust her. Will you let her join your crew?
SPCE141*#*Let this lovely lady look at your wounds. She knows a thing or two about medicine.
SPCE142*#*Before we approach anyone in town, make sure to stuff your pockets with garlic. You can trust no one.
SPCE143*#*Here are more rings for my favorite captain.
SPCE144*#*This bloke here is the best tracker I know. He can help us find the Count. And he is strong as a bull, so if you need to carry loads of stuff, give him a call.
SPCE145*#*I have a feeling we are not rid of Van Helsing yet. Best to keep some muscle around.
SPCE146*#*I may die here but at least you save yourself, captain.
SPCE147*#*This is your last reward, captain. Now get out of here if you cherish your life.
SPCE148*#*Thank you and goodbye, captain! Ah, please take this infernal garlic with you. Van Helsing must have left it here but I can't stand the stench of it.
SPCE149*#*Congratulations! You have earned your reward, captain.
SPCE150*#*Until later, captain! I hope we will see each other again next year. Have fun with Mr. Diesel.
SPCE151*#*Let's have a short break, captain, and welcome our two new assistants. I am sure they will help us finish our work much faster.
SPCE152*#*I hope you will take good care of my invention. A ship deserves love like any young maiden. Farewell, captain.
SPCE153*#*You bought the ship? That must have been really expensive. So are we going to America now?
SPCE154*#*Are you leaving already? Promise that you will be back soon! I don't want to be alone.
SPCE155*#*I understand that you are busy but don't be afraid to get some help. Look, here is a sailor ready to assist you.
SPCE156*#*Thank you for helping me, captain. Before, I thought I might not get to see the New Year at all. But now I know everything will be well.
SPCE157*#*This is probably the most wonderful Christmas, captain. Thank you for everything. It's so great to see Eva happy.
SPCE158*#*It was a productive time we spent together, captain. And here is the fruit of our work, MS Selandia. Take care of her. Goodbye!
SPCE159*#*Here it is, dear. Merry Christmas!
SPCE160*#*Thank you, captain. This was really the happiest Christmas in my life. Please remember to visit us sometimes.
SPCE161*#*I definitely plan on returning to the cold Southern Continent. How about you? Are you ready to explore the frozen wasteland?
SPCE162*#*We made it, captain! The way back seemed much faster and easier than the journey to the pole. Thank you for your help and enjoy your reward.
SPCE163*#*We will stay at the camp here and maybe the temperature will rise a bit and let us go on. Just bring help if you can.
SPCE164*#*I can’t wait to learn more about Harald’s life. But first, here is your part of the treasure we found. The rest of it will go into the museum.
SPCE165*#*Here is something to make your voyage more pleasant. Go now!
SPCE166*#*Wait! Here is a small gift for you. These precious runestones can be used as a payment or to tell your fortune. Either way, they will be useful on your voyage.

SPCT971*#*Hello again, captain
SPCT972*#*Come closer!
SPCT973*#*Stop right there!
SPCT974*#*You seem familiar
SPCT975*#*Greetings, sailor!
SPCT976*#*Help!
SPCT977*#*How do you do?
SPCT978*#*Hello there
SPCT979*#*Good day to you
SPCT980*#*Look at the trees!
SPCT981*#*Going south
SPCT982*#*Careful, captain!
SPCT983*#*Our paths cross
SPCT984*#*Wait a second!
SPCT985*#*Don’t worry
SPCT986*#*Let’s trade!
SPCT987*#*What do I see?
SPCT988*#*Come here, fishy
SPCT989*#*Not so fast, cap’n!
SPCT990*#*You found me
SPCT991*#*Arrr, who goes here?
SPCT992*#*Here, we are here!
SPCT993*#*Welcome to Far East
SPCT994*#*Hello, brave sailor!
SPCT995*#*Dear captain!
SPCT996*#*A little break
SPCT997*#*Come in, captain!
SPCT998*#*Hands up!
SPCT999*#*Why so scared?
SPCX000*#*We need to wait until spring before we set off again. Meanwhile, we can send a ship for supplies to Buenos Aires. I hate this waiting, but there is no point going out there only to freeze to death.
SPCX001*#*Ever heard of chocolate? Far away there's a land where the cacao trees grow. If we find it, we’ll be able to make our own chocolate here! Raise the money for the voyage.
SPCX002*#*Of course we need a ship but where will we keep it? First of all, we have to build the docks. Make sure that the best materials will be used!
SPCX003*#*Perfect, the docks are already under construction. Now it’s time to start building our ship. The journey won’t be easy so it better be unsinkable!
SPCX004*#*The ship looks splendid! I’m sure it will be legendary. We’re almost ready to take the voyage but we have no food supplies yet. Will you plan the menu?
SPCX005*#*Out of sight, out of mind – this is what I fear the most. What if my wife forgets me? Tell the mayor to build a bust of me in town so I can keep my eyes on her.
SPCX006*#*It hasn’t even been a month on board and half of the crew is already seasick. We have to drop anchor in the closest bay and get some medicine.
SPCX007*#*It would be a shame to leave this beautiful place without tasting the local cuisine. Load the bags with spices and refill the food supplies!
SPCX008*#*Men overboard!!! We have to rescue them – hurry up and drop the lifeboats. May this disaster be over soon…
SPCX009*#*Damage is everywhere! Among other things, the anchor is broken too. We need materials for the reparations or we’ll float in the ocean forever.
SPCX010*#*Look, New World is on the horizon! It’s time to celebrate so grab the drinks and food. Europe will melt in chocolate when we come back!
SPCX011*#*Have a glass of wine and take a seat. As you’ve heard, our king’s highest wish is to break into the world of spice trade. Are you in? Then grab your cash and join me!
SPCX012*#*It will be a long cruise and one ship won’t be enough. Two ships? That’s for amateurs! Three ships sound reasonable but we can do better. We need to build at least 4!
SPCX013*#*Fishing is not really my thing and I guess yours neither. We need fishermen to join our crew so I’ve arranged a little dinner with them. Don’t forget to suit up!
SPCX014*#*That was a fancy meal, wasn’t it? Oh no, I seem to have forgotten my money at home, could you lend me some? I’ll pay it off right away, I promise.
SPCX015*#*Great news amigo! Fishermen are thrilled to join us but they have one condition – the king’s cooks will have to use exclusively their catchings. Sounds fair, right?
SPCX016*#*I’ve heard that you’re friends with Mr. Columbus, why haven’t you told me? That’s wonderful news! Visit him and bring some cocoa. It might come in handy later.
SPCX017*#*Even the best ship is worthless without a skillful crew. We need the best navigators, sailors and translators in the whole kingdom so choose wisely and pay them well.
SPCX018*#*Or a steak! Make sure the chefs have a fully equipped kitchen. Can you imagine eating only boiled meat all the time? Disgusting! Each ship needs a nice stone oven.
SPCX019*#*No great voyage has ever been made without a single scratch. Hope for the best - prepare for the worst! Don’t forget to load up materials for reparations.
SPCX020*#*We need to have one last dinner with our king. This time, it’s on us so we have to make an effort. If you’d like to ask him anything, do it now or never!
SPCX021*#*The big day has come. Please, do me a favor and pay the last harbor fees. Oh, and just so you know – our first stop is in Africa.
SPCX022*#*I’ve just checked the cocoa from Mr. Columbus and I must say that he used to be more generous. Luckily, there’s Africa on the horizon so we can debark and get some more.
SPCX023*#*We’re sweating in Africa while it’s Christmas in Portugal! Look, I’ve made you a belt as a gift. No, it’s not a sailing rope you silly! What will you give me in return?
SPCX024*#*If only our king were more generous with the wood. The ships need a bit of repair work so go and get some wood before we leave.
SPCX025*#*What is this place? I’m afraid that my navigation skills have failed! Don’t tell anyone or I’ll be the first man overboard. Let’s pretend we’re trading iron with sultan.
SPCX026*#*We have successfully managed to offend the sultan with our poor metal exchange offer. Lesson learned, we'd better focus on coins. The locals are furious, let's get away!
SPCX027*#*Let’s try not to insult the local citizens this time. Bring these lovely people on board and tell the chefs to prepare the best meals Portugal can offer!
SPCX028*#*We don’t have any gift for the Indian king! I’m afraid I’ll have to use my craft skills again. Bring me wood and I’ll figure something out.
SPCX029*#*Well, my wooden decoration isn’t very appealing. At least, the king seems to be amused, don’t you think? Or… maybe not. A handful of gold will surely be more appropriate.
SPCX030*#*Let’s not forget why we came here! Take all the cocoa and trade it for spices our king has never tasted before. I’m sure your devoted service will be generously rewarded.
SPCX031*#*My name is John and I have a dream: one day, I want to make a fortune! Join me for a dinner at my family’s residence and I’ll tell you the plan.
SPCX032*#*As you have probably noticed, my family is pretty wealthy. However, I haven’t bought even a single spoon in this house! Therefore, I want to build my own business.
SPCX033*#*Thank you for the supplies but before I share my masterplan with you, I’d appreciate if you proved me that you’re trustworthy. Do you have a deposit for any case of need?
SPCX034*#*Wonderful! Now take a good look around. Do you see all these people wearing those ugly dull clothes? Get me a hand-loom and I’ll show you something.
SPCX035*#*Life’s too short to wear grey! I want to make fabrics full of vivid colors. Trade the precious cocoa for the most beautiful threads available.
SPCX036*#*… we’ll learn to weave! Oh, you've brought a manual? Come on, we can figure it out on our own! You’d rather get us food and wine – this will be a long night.
SPCX037*#*Our first scarf is ready! What a beautiful color, what a beautiful texture! Let’s decorate it with some precious stones and it will be just perfect.
SPCX038*#*Will someone else be as excited as we are? How much would the others actually pay for the scarf? We need to find out! Book us a stand on the marketplace.
SPCX039*#*Whenever someone asks you about the scarf, tell them, that it was originally made for the Indian Queen. The market stand must be luxurious too!
SPCX040*#*It's unbelievable how much these people are willing to pay for a humble scarf. Can you imagine how much we could earn one day? Quickly, bring the money box!
SPCX041*#*The auction is over and our result is: a fancy dinner plus we still have some money left. Mmm... I can already smell the success!
SPCX042*#*What do you mean we ran out of thread? Was all of it used for that small piece of fabric? Well, we need to restock our supplies! You already know how to do it, right?
SPCX043*#*The conditions for starting our own business are perfect! You look surprised but I knew it from the very beginning. Are you ready to build our first manufacture?
SPCX044*#*We need the best craftsmen in the whole town but they all seem to be working for other merchants. Take these coins and convince them to join us!
SPCX045*#*Weavers – check, manufactory – check, handlooms – not enough! We need at least dozen, so hurry up and get some more.
SPCX046*#*Our manufacture is in full swing. So many beautiful fabrics! There’s no need to go to the marketplace anymore – we can make a private one. Invite our wealthiest clients!
SPCX047*#*Countess Radcliffe LOVES our fabrics. She’d like us to meet her cousin who lives in London – Mr. Quarles. She says he’s got some proposal for us. Get the carriage ready!
SPCX048*#*Mr. Quarles is the Master Draper of the great Drapers' Company of London. He‘s a well respected man, so we must make an effort! Precious stones will surely please him.
SPCX049*#*What a faux pas! I was so busy that I absolutely forgot to pay our workers. Please, sort it out before we leave. We don’t want any strikes, do we?
SPCX050*#*Wonderful. It hasn't been even one day on the road and our carriage got broken. We need to fix the wheels quickly, otherwise we’re going to be late!
SPCX051*#*I’m dying to know what kind of offer we’ll get. Let’s get some cocoa before we meet with Mr. Quarles. I heard he has a sweet tooth.
SPCX052*#*A 7-year apprenticeship in London?! We’ve already built our own cloth-business and now we should start from scratch? Let’s go to a pub, I need to think it through.
SPCX053*#*Being freemen of the great Drapers' Company of London would surely open new doors for us. If you're in, then I'm in too. It won't be easy though!
SPCX054*#*The best things in life are for free, but it seems like a good education is priceless. It’s time to pay the school fees.
SPCX055*#*You know what? We’re too old to live in a dorm. I’ve rented a lovely castle near London. Furnish it however you like!
SPCX056*#*The teachers are excellent but the equipment is rather time-worn. Let's upgrade it!
SPCX057*#*The day has finally come! Believe it or not - we’re officially merchants of the great Drapers' Company of London. Something tells me that the best is yet to come. Cheers!
SPCX058*#*All those years were worth it - we’ve managed to build a great empire and the orders keep on growing. Let’s improve our workshops; we can’t afford a single mistake.
SPCX059*#*I've just received an exclusive request from Holland: the Dutch king wants us to create a fabric for his daughter’s wedding dress. The more expensive the better!
SPCX060*#*This could be the official name of our wedding cloth. It’s light as a feather and soft as an angel’s wing. Simply stunning! Pack it carefully and send it to Holland.
SPCX061*#*to a woman’s heart! I’ve heard that Dutch princess has a sweet tooth so pack in a box of fine chocolate too. Let’s hope she doesn’t have to watch her figure.
SPCX062*#*This is my favorite part of the day. Standing here in the harbor and watching the ships taking our fabrics far, far away… Oh, give me a napkin, I'm overwhelmed with joy!
SPCX063*#*… a girl’s best friend! Or, least, a best friend of the Dutch princess. She loves the wedding fabric, but she wants us to embroider it with precious stones.
SPCX064*#*...and this is just the beginning, my friend.  Let’s expand abroad, improve our manufacturing and hire more workers!  We have our hands full with work…
SPCX065*#*Isn’t all the fuss making you tired? I admire your excitement, but… I wish I had a small house in the countryside where I could spend my days reading and feeding ducks…
SPCX066*#*We’re making expensive cloth for the richest folks in Europe while there are dozens of people in need among us. We should donate some of our earnings to charity.
SPCX067*#*A single donation is not enough. We are so wealthy that we can’t even imagine what it’s like to have an empty stomach. We should cook for the poor every week!
SPCX068*#*Yesterday’s dinner for the poor made me realize one more thing – these people have no place to stay! Please, take care of the business and I’ll get them an accommodation.
SPCX069*#*Nobody should ever end up on the street and we must do what we can to prevent it. Our business is growing and these people could work for us. Build more manufactures!
SPCX070*#*Your business talent is incredible but I've decided to dedicate my life to charity. Our cloth company is now in your hands. Take good care of it and visit me sometime!
SPCX071*#*Ahoy, captain! My name is Amerigo Vespucci. I’m sorry, but I’m too busy to talk to you right now. I want to build a new school and I’m desperately looking for some stone.
SPCX072*#*Oh, that’s great! My workers have just arrived and they need their money. You know what it’s like these days - people don’t lift a finger unless they’re paid.
SPCX073*#*Did you know that cocoa is good for your health? I didn’t know it either. Do you think you could get me some? My men would like to taste it.
SPCX074*#*Amico, you’re still here! That is splendid. My navigation school urgently needs wood for the roof and the delivery is over 2 weeks late! Can you do something about it?
SPCX075*#*First the wood, now the nails! All of them have become rusty. Can you believe that? However, if you bring me some iron, we can make new ones.
SPCX076*#*It was a very long and hard month, but we’ve made it. Come, my amici, let’s go to a pub together. We deserve a bit of fun, don’t we?
SPCX077*#*I’d like to prepare a huge dinner for the whole town, but I’m afraid that I’ve miscalculated a bit. Could you help me out?
SPCX078*#*The school I’m building... pardon, WE are building together is almost finished! What we need now is some wood for the basic equipment like chairs and tables.
SPCX079*#*I have an idea! Let’s build statues of ourselves in front of the school. If you get the materials, I’ll take care of the rest. It will be marvellous!
SPCX080*#*Next week, there’s going to be a fishing contest at the lake near the town. Everyone is excited, but we have a problem - there are hardly any fish in the lake...
SPCX081*#*The cocoa is truly magical. My stone cutters work like horses when I give them some. It seems like it’s giving them energy...
SPCX082*#*Our school is almost done. Now we need to fit the windows and I’m looking for more wood. Don’t worry, I’ll reward you generously!
SPCX083*#*The school is nice. It really is! But it’s terribly cold inside and I hate cold. We'd better get some nice stoves.
SPCX084*#*We should get prepared for the school opening ceremony. Many things need to be considered - especially finances!
SPCX085*#*We should cook some traditional local food for the ceremony. Bring ingredients that can be easily prepared and taste good too.
SPCX086*#*The opening ceremony won’t do without a huge bonfire. We’ll make a fire that no one has ever seen before!
SPCX087*#*Each of our guests has to get a gift. My friend is a jeweller and he’ll make us beautiful marble necklaces and rings.
SPCX088*#*The town wants us to pay fees for the ceremony. Can you believe that?! What a scandal! They won’t get any presents from us. We’ve done enough for them!
SPCX089*#*Do you think our guests would be pleased if we brought them cocoa? They have never eaten anything like that before. They will surely be excited! At least I hope so…
SPCX090*#*I don’t remember much, but everyone is saying that it was a great evening! I’ve also met a guy who would like to buy some stone from you.
SPCX091*#*The city council is desperately looking for some high quality iron. Do you think you can get them what they need? For the sake of a good relationship...and a good reward!
SPCX092*#*Local lumber mill needs some equipment upgrades, but they lack financial resources. They will supply us with high quality wood in return.
SPCX093*#*You surely know what a compass is, right? Well we need some iron for that. Luckily, I have some friends who will trade sufficient iron for some top-notch tuna. Deal?
SPCX094*#*Our students will also learn how to repair a ship. We need a lot of wood for these lessons. Who would have thought that running a navigation school would be this hard?
SPCX095*#*The jeweller, who made us the necklaces for the ceremony, would like to buy more stone from you. It was the best one he’s ever worked with!
SPCX096*#*My marine navigation lessons have become really popular! It seems like I’ll need an assistant soon. Can you get me someone? I’ll reward you with a fresh batch of fish!
SPCX097*#*Soon, I’ll be dispatching my ships with various goods to Rome. This means, that your cocoa must be shipped too!
SPCX098*#*Did you know that I’m from an Italian town called Florence? Well, now you know! From there I will be transporting some precious stone. Help me deliver it to Rome with your ships.
SPCX099*#*They must be joking! My crew has just told me that some monster ate their anchor. A ship can’t sail without an anchor… well, actually it can, but it definitely shouldn’t!
SPCX100*#*I used to live in a temple for a couple of months in Florence. All I can tell you is, that the place means a lot to me. Therefore, I’d like to donate them some money.
SPCX1000*#*I am building a bridge between the islands. The sea is restless here, full of whirlpools and strong currents. If we want to get to the riches of the island beyond, there must be a bridge.
SPCX1001*#*You must go back to England, to the headquarters of Virginia Company. Tell them they want to execute John Smith. Quickly! The captain plans to hang me right after we arrive.
SPCX1002*#*Is it something that will grant me my life? A letter? I hope there is something very convincing written inside. Otherwise you can prepare the gallows.
SPCX1003*#*I exaggerate, but you saved me so I will be eternally grateful. The letter actually made me one of the leaders of the colonization efforts here in Virginia. Now let’s celebrate!
SPCX1004*#*I didn’t tell you what it was all about, right? The captain charged me with leading a mutiny. Falsely, of course. He just needed a scapegoat. Now can you help me build the settlement?
SPCX1005*#*This swampy land here is not a good site for a settlement. We need to move upriver and look for a better place. Take the materials and some equipment and let’s explore the country.
SPCX1006*#*Do you see this plant over there? It has large red fruit. It looks tasty, maybe it’s edible. Or it could be poisonous, but we won’t know until we try.
SPCX1007*#*Well, I am still feeling fine. Looks like the red fruit is good to eat. I take it as a sign that here is a fine place for the colony. Take your men and bring all the material here.
SPCX1008*#*First we need to make temporary houses of wood. We can build them pretty fast, so we won’t have to sleep under the stars. Then we can concentrate on the durable buildings.
SPCX1009*#*Some of the men are not feeling well. Maybe the water is foul so close to the marshes. You are a seasoned captain, can you sail back to London, and buy some medicine?
SPCX101*#*I was thinking about the missing anchor. This has never happened to me. We have to find out what caused it. Let’s bait a trap with fish and wait to see what shows up.
SPCX1010*#*Good that you are back. New settlers have arrived a short while ago. We don’t have enough houses or food for them. There is so much work, I don’t know what to do first.
SPCX1011*#*The village is burning! Quick! Bring water! I hope you have enough jars or buckets to carry it here. The iron pots might serve, too. Just hurry, before it all ends up in a pile of ash.
SPCX1012*#*So much work destroyed! All the wooden houses are burned to the ground. We need to build new ones from stone. I am not risking a similar catastrophe again.
SPCX1013*#*More ships with settlers have arrived. Looks like the king and the Virginia Company mean to make this settlement successful at all cost. Tell your men to show the newcomers around.
SPCX1014*#*We need to plant more crops. The food supplies are depleting and we can’t rely on the ships bringing more food from England. Let’s try planting the red fruit. It’s local, so it should grow well.
SPCX1015*#*We are going on a little adventure. We will explore the rivers which flow into the bay. A friend will oversee the settlement in the meantime. Let’s leave him some money, so he can trade with the natives.
SPCX1016*#*I am going to make a map of the land surrounding our settlement. I will sketch it on paper first, but then I want to engrave it on a wood block to last longer. Let’s hope, there will be no more fires.
SPCX1017*#*While we were gone new settlers arrived from Europe. There are some German, Polish, and Slovak craftsmen too. We can use their skills, but let’s give them something to eat first.
SPCX1018*#*So many people need to live somewhere. We have to build new and non-burnable houses. There is a hill behind the village, where we mine stone. Will you go and bring some?
SPCX1019*#*We have had a visit from the natives. They brought us food, including the red fruit we have already discovered. They call it tomatl, kind of hard to pronounce. Let’s include it in today’s meal.
SPCX102*#*We'll build a wooden trap and bait it with fish.  When the monster arrives it will be caught in the trap, then we can sell it!
SPCX1020*#*There are too many people now. I can’t speak with each one of them, and I see that not all are working as they should. Everyone has to do his part to make this settlement prosper.
SPCX1021*#*Since we arrived here, we had good relations with the Indians. They brought us food, and we gave them some of our tools. But something changed now. Better be ready for anything.
SPCX1022*#*Did you see them hiding in the woods, and watching us? I don’t like this. Let’s try to trade with them again. Maybe they will remember what good neighbors we are.
SPCX1023*#*The Indians don’t want to trade with us anymore. Just when we have shortage of food again. I sent some men to hunt and fish. I know you are a good fisherman, will you join them?
SPCX1024*#*We have food for the next few days, but we are facing hard times, I am afraid. Put the fish into wooden boxes, and we will store them in the cellar, so they don’t get spoiled.
SPCX1025*#*The natives have attacked our hunting party. I don’t know what is happening, but we must take precautions. We will build a wall around the village to fortify it. They mustn't destroy our homes.
SPCX1026*#*I have heard rumors about some people wanting to abandon the settlement, and return home. But we don’t have enough supplies for the long voyage. And I am not just giving up now!
SPCX1027*#*I decided to station guardsmen in front of the gate to the village. We were too careless with the security before. If you know some men, who would be willing to do this, send them to me.
SPCX1028*#*Our first guards are ready. We need to give them some weapons. I don’t know if they can use them, but the Indians know our weapons already, and will think twice about attacking us.
SPCX1029*#*Get your pistol or sword, whatever you prefer, just be ready. They are coming. I will lead the defense. You take some men and go hide all our gold and treasures.
SPCX103*#*We have to weigh the cage so it doesn’t float away. Stone is exactly what we need! Don’t worry, you’ll get paid.
SPCX1030*#*Don’t mind the blood, it’s not mine. If the gold is hidden, go look for some food. Leave the fighting to us. You are no warrior, and I don’t want you to get hurt.
SPCX1031*#*Are you with the strangers, who live near the river? Our men brought you tied up from the cove. You were fishing on our land. Don’t worry, I told them not to hurt you.
SPCX1032*#*This is our town Werowocomoco. Don’t worry if you can’t pronounce it. I will untie you, but you must give me any weapons, that you still carry.
SPCX1033*#*I spoke with my father Powhatan, he is the chieftain of our clan. He said that if you prove to be useful, he will let you live. We need people, who know where to get various materials.
SPCX1034*#*We need to move our village, this place gets flooded every spring. You said you command many men on the big water. Tell them to help us move our things over the river.
SPCX1035*#*His hair and beard are pale. Is he your friend? My father is angry. I fear he will want to kill him. Come, we must get there now. But first let’s disguise you as one of our own.
SPCX1036*#*I saved him in the last second. I was afraid father’s club would hit me, when I threw myself before the Englishman, to save him from the blow. If father sees that he has gold, he will treat him better.
SPCX1037*#*Now father thinks the Englishman is an important person. He plans to make a big feast for John Smith. That is the Englishman's name. We should go and prepare the food now.
SPCX1038*#*You thought we live in the tipis, right? That are the homes of our cousins from the north. We build these thatched houses. Men prepare the base, and women the straw for the roof.
SPCX1039*#*I talked with John Smith. He wants to build a safe home for his people here. He will need a lot of stone to build a wall that will keep all the clans away. They don’t like so many strangers in our land.
SPCX104*#*It seems like the sea monster tricked us! The trap stayed at the same place, but the fish are gone. How is this possible? Let’s try it again.
SPCX1040*#*Father released John Smith, and he went back home. But he had to promise to send men to help us fight against the Chowanoke clan. You should send some too, this will be a difficult battle.
SPCX1041*#*The Chowanoke are very good fighters. To defeat them you must teach us how to make metal weapons like yours. It will be difficult, but we want to learn.
SPCX1042*#*Help me prepare the feather headbands for our men. They must wear them into the battle. The headbands are a sign of their previous victories, and so make our enemies fear us more.
SPCX1043*#*Women do not fight in our tribe. We take care of other things, like tending the fire, preparing food, and farming. You as an honored guest should not endanger yourself either.
SPCX1044*#*Father wants more weapons from the Englishmen. But we have nothing to trade right now. There is not much food at this time of the year. Do you have something to trade with them?
SPCX1045*#*It’s been long since I have seen John Smith. He looks well, but he was sad. His people don’t have enough food. I will try to get something for him, but I must hide it well.
SPCX1046*#*We need to gather materials to replenish the arrows and weapons after the battle. We have enough wood, but the arrow heads and clubs are made from stone.
SPCX1047*#*I have gathered some more food for John Smith and his people. I can’t carry it all. Will you and your men help me bring it to them? But try not to be seen, my father doesn’t like me going there.
SPCX1048*#*John Smith told me about his home beyond the big water. Are there really huge stone villages? I wish I could see it for myself. I want to make a feather headdress for him, to thank him for the stories.
SPCX1049*#*Will you come with me? I am bringing the headdress to John Smith. I want to bring some food too. You are friends, right? I am sure he would like to see you again.
SPCX105*#*AGAIN NOTHING?! I, Amerigo Vespucci, the most famous navigator and explorer won’t be tricked that easily! Let’s set the cocoa as a bait closer to the shore and watch it.
SPCX1050*#*This can’t be true! John Smith is not here. They told me he is dead. My father sent men for me, that I should return immediately. Something bad is happening.
SPCX1051*#*We are fighting the English. Father decided he will not leave our land to them. He sends me to the Patawomack people. They are our friends, I should be safe there.
SPCX1052*#*Will you help me pack my things? Put it all into these wooden crates. My horse will carry it, so I can take all I need. It all happened so fast. Will you try to find out what happened to John Smith?
SPCX1053*#*My friend! I have been kidnapped! Can you help me? The Englishmen hold me here, in this settlement, against my will. They made a pact with the Patawomacks and captured me.
SPCX1054*#*You couldn't convince them to let me go? It’s fine, they ask only for the English captives to be released, and for some weapons. It’s only fair, and they did not hurt me. I am just a bit hungry.
SPCX1055*#*They take care of me here, so do not worry. And it’s actually quite comfortable living in a stone house. I only miss John Smith, it would be much more pleasant here with his company.
SPCX1056*#*I am so bored locked up here. I just watch the birds out of my window as they fly free across the sky. If you can find some feathers, I could make a few headbands to pass the time.
SPCX1057*#*I decided to take up a new name Rebecca. I have already had more names before. You are my true friend, so I will tell you my first name, it’s Matoaka. Pocahontas is just a nickname.
SPCX1058*#*Father has already let the English hostages go, yet he did not have enough weapons to please my captors. If you know how, please try to make them see, that they should free me.
SPCX1059*#*I have met another Englishman named John. He is a farmer, and is very kind to me. His wife and child have died a while ago. I want to make wooden carving of them, to remember them by.
SPCX106*#*No monster! Just some ordinary local thieves! I caught them with my men while they were trying to steal our cocoa bait out from the trap. Can you believe it? Haha!
SPCX1060*#*The farmer’s name is John Rolfe. He has invited me to dinner. I am afraid to go alone. Will you joins us? I hear you must leave soon. At least we can spend some last time together.
SPCX1061*#*I just go under my new name now, and wear different clothes. Please, come visit me in my new home in London. Me and my husband would like to invite you and your sailors for dinner.
SPCX1062*#*Please, excuse the mess here. Our house is in need of renovation. Maybe you remember my husband, John Rolfe? He was away for a long time, so the house got a bit neglected.
SPCX1063*#*I see you have not forgotten how much I liked chocolate. My people used to make a drink out of the cocoa beans, it was tasty too, but I like this solid form even more.
SPCX1064*#*I so miss them, and our beautiful country too. But my beloved wanted to go back to London, and so I agreed. And I was curious about the stone cities, and metal machines of Europe.
SPCX1065*#*I met John Smith yesterday! He looked just as dashing as I remember, even though his hair spotted the first signs of grey. He lived all this time. Let’s go to an inn, where we can talk in private.
SPCX1066*#*At that time, when they told me he was dead, John Smith needed to return home. He was badly injured, and had to to see a good doctor. Let’s order some fried fish. They are really tasty here.
SPCX1067*#*My husband would be jealous if he heard me talk about John. But I was young then. It was just a girlish crush. I love my husband, and I am happy now. I help him with his shipping business.
SPCX1068*#*I hope I will convince my husband to return to Tsenacommacah again... I mean to New England. He is concentrating on the renovation of the house. It’s almost done now.
SPCX1069*#*It will be for just a few months at most, but it’s good to go home again. I am going to take a piece of chocolate to every member of our clan. I know they will love it just like I do.
SPCX107*#*I've got some surprising news; there’s a bounty on the heads of these thieves! I suggest transporting them in an iron cage, so they can’t escape.
SPCX1070*#*I am glad we could see each other again. I have one last request of you, my friend. Help us finish the fence around our house, so we can leave for my homeland soon.
SPCX1071*#*Are you on an important business? If not maybe you could join our fleet. We are on a mission by the West India Company to explore the Pacific and find the great southern continent.
SPCX1072*#*We have not seen land for some days. According to the journal of explorers that sailed here before us we should head to the southwest now. Check your compass, mine is broken.
SPCX1073*#*We saw a turtle yesterday, and there are birds above us too. There must be some land nearby. I am curious what kind of birds those are. Try to lure them in with some fish.
SPCX1074*#*According to the type of birds those are... I have no idea where we are. I am no ornithologist. We will send one ship ahead to scout the waters. Let’s hope they will spot something.
SPCX1075*#*The ship is waiting for us. Looks like they really spotted some land. According to the location it could be the Sandy Island. Prepare the boats, so we can get closer and find a good spot to anchor.
SPCX1076*#*Today is the Easter Sunday, so we shall name it the Easter Island. The boats are ready? Good. But be careful not to hit the rocks. The shore looks dangerous. I will wait on the ship.
SPCX1077*#*You found rabbits on the island? I must say I have had enough fish for dinner for a lifetime. They are really cute, I feel somewhat bad about eating them.
SPCX1078*#*But we can’t feed the whole fleet with rabbit meat, or there would be none left. The crew will have to make do with fish. And in the morning we set off to explore the island together.
SPCX1079*#*I see you brought an Islander with you too. I don’t understand a word he is saying, but he seems intrigued with our ship and equipment. Let’s give him some trifles we don’t need.
SPCX108*#*I guess you know what cartography is. You probably also know that I’m a master of cartography. I’d like to teach the students in our school how to draw maps correctly.
SPCX1080*#*The Indian seemed pretty inclined to just take our things. We better hide our gold in case we meet more natives tomorrow. I will send the man back to the island in the meantime.
SPCX1081*#*Pick some sailors to accompany us to the beach. We are taking only two boats so make sure you choose reliable men. We can’t take everyone.
SPCX1082*#*Now, that we are closer, it’s clear that this is not the Sandy Island. The thing I thought to be sand are in truth dried up bushes. Do you have the paddles? Now row so we get to the shore fast.
SPCX1083*#*You will have to jump out of the boat and try to move the rocks so we make a provisional pier, where we can leave the boats. This is not an ideal beach for anchoring, but it is better than the reef.
SPCX1084*#*The natives are already waiting for us on the beach. They look friendly, but we have to be careful. I hope you and your men have armed yourselves.
SPCX1085*#*The natives brought us some gifts. There are vegetables, fruit, and a few of the rabbits in wooden cages. Take it all to the ship. We will wait for you on the beach.
SPCX1086*#*Did you hear the gunshots from the back? All the natives have run away. Let’s find out what happened. I hope they did not steal our gold. Go check if everything is safely in place.
SPCX1087*#*The Indians wanted to take a jacket from one of our sailors, and when he would not give it, they took up rocks. So our men started shooting. Prepare food to placate them. They got quite scared.
SPCX1088*#*Have you brought the food? Good. Let the sailors give it to the natives. They are looking calmer now, don’t you think? Tell everyone there will be no more shooting, just give them what they want.
SPCX1089*#*They have more gifts for us, but nothing precious. I thought they have pearls on their necklaces but these are only shells. Still, the bananas might do our sailors good. Pack them into the crates.
SPCX109*#*I’m making a dinner and I’ve invited a couple of experienced navigators too. I’d like to plan the content for our new school subject and I want to hear your opinion.
SPCX1090*#*They are fascinated by our weapons. I don’t want to give them our best pieces. If you have some old blunt cutlasses, we can give them those. Let’s hope they won’t hurt themselves.
SPCX1091*#*It’s a mystery how they cook their food. They just build a fire over some pebbles, and after a while bring us cooked meat. Let’s bring them more rocks so they show us how they are doing it.
SPCX1092*#*I really like the local rabbits. I am thinking of bringing a few of them back with us. It’s a different type than we have in Netherlands. I am sure my daughter would like one as a pet, too.
SPCX1093*#*I am fascinated by these large statues on the hill. I wanted to inspect them closely, but the natives wouldn’t let me. Maybe if we pay them, they would let us get closer.
SPCX1094*#*I can’t believe that these primitive people were able to build these enormous statues. They are still not happy if we touch the gigants. So tell your men to behave.
SPCX1095*#*I believe they cook the food in hollowed out rocks underground and build fire over them. Peculiar way to cook. Let’s watch what they do with some fish from us.
SPCX1096*#*The night here can be really cold. But there are not many trees on the island. Just a few palm trees and some shrubs. Let’s use a few old planks meant for ship repairs to build a fire.
SPCX1097*#*The chieftain invites us to the other part of the island. But we have yet to finish our mission, so we need to go. Let’s decline politely, and leave them some of our tools as a goodbye gift.
SPCX1098*#*We have left the natives so many things, that our ships are now too light and don’t sit well on the water. We will need some sailing ballast to keep the ships upright.
SPCX1099*#*We need to find the real Sandy Island and Terra Australis beyond. Let’s pack up, and don’t forget some food supplies. Who knows how long the voyage will be until we reach another land.
SPCX110*#*I’m designing a new ship, but we don’t have enough materials. Don’t you have some wood for sale? I’ll pay you well.
SPCX1100*#*You want to stay here? I understand, I am intrigued by the locals and their gigantic statues too. Let’s just settle our debts, and I will be on my way. Enjoy your stay on the Easter Island.
SPCX1101*#*I see you are fishing in these waters. Is there any land nearby? My name is Felipe Gonzales, I set off from Peru to explore the waters to the west.
SPCX1102*#*I can see it now, the Easter Island. You say it is inhabited? Yes, there is some smoke from camp fires on the horizon. I will send out a group of sailors to find a good spot for landing.
SPCX1103*#*There are people on the hill. They must have seen us. We should expect a welcoming party on the shore. Lower the boats on water and let’s get inside.
SPCX1104*#*I can see some strange large shrubs on the hill. Let’s go to the shore and prepare to meet the natives. I trust you when you say they are friendly, but we need some weapons just in case.
SPCX1105*#*So those are no bushes but statues. And the natives built them? Amazing. They seem really happy to see us, they are waving and smiling. Let’s ask them about the statues.
SPCX1106*#*We managed to make a deal with them. They will make us a few smaller statues, the moai as they call them, for some clothing and trinkets in return. Will you help us transport them?
SPCX1107*#*I found a small cavity in the statues. The natives hide there the bones of their dead. Maybe they are some kind of burial monuments. Let’s pay our homage to the dead too.
SPCX1108*#*I think they want to take us to their village. We must leave some men with the ships. The natives are friendly, but they will take everything that is not nailed down.
SPCX1109*#*This must be the village, the houses are really simple. Looks like they have already prepared some food for us. Let’s give them something tasty too. Then the feast can begin.
SPCX111*#*The town is building a church but it suffers from lack of marble. They told me to ask you for help. In return, they will give you the most precious thing they have!
SPCX1110*#*They use no metals neither for tools or for decoration. I suppose they have not had any contact with European people before. Maybe we could gift them some of our pots and pans.
SPCX1111*#*I want to take some of the moai to Europe. I believe this will be the hit in every wealthy man’s garden. If we get the Indians the material, they will make more statues for us.
SPCX1112*#*The natives must use the trunks of palm trees to roll the statues on the chosen place where they erect them. Let’s get them some trees to use after they finish the new statues.
SPCX1113*#*I will pay them for the moai, of course. Such craftsmanship deserves a reward. I wonder if they will have any use for the gold here. But we will need our weapons and the remaining equipment.
SPCX1114*#*The stonemasons have finished the statues. We will have to free some space in the cargo hold. They are large and really heavy. Be careful not to damage them.
SPCX1115*#*I hope you did not try to transport the statues alone. You will hurt yourself with such large objects. Take some men with you. The natives will surely help you too.
SPCX1116*#*I have looked around the island. There are no domestic animals if you don’t count the rats. The plantations are looking poor too. The natives are not good fishermen either. Let’s help them a bit.
SPCX1117*#*I want to show the locals how to make proper weapons. Let’s try something simple, a bow and some arrows. Bring me an axe and a knife, and I will get to work right away.
SPCX1118*#*It’s been some time since I last made a bow. This wood is now good only as a kindling. This was just a test of the material anyway. I will need new wood now.
SPCX1119*#*This bow looks good. Once I gave it to one of the locals, he hanged it around his neck. Let’s make the arrows and show them how it’s used. The arrowheads can be made from stone.
SPCX112*#*The annual fish market takes place in the town again. It’s really important to support the local market - the fishermen will be thankful for every coin.
SPCX1120*#*You decided to build a harbor here? The shore on the island is quite rocky. But you are right, when someone visits next, it will come in handy. I can sell you any material you need.
SPCX1121*#*I have been thinking about leaving something here to be remembered by. I want to know my men’s opinion too. Call the sailors to the camp so we can have a talk.
SPCX1122*#*We have a plan now. First, we will need to move the statues from the three highest hills. Take some men with you and be careful not to damage them. The natives might not take that kindly.
SPCX1123*#*The plan is to make three crosses, and raise them on the three hills. So that they are seen from far away. Let’s get some food into our bellies, before we get to work.
SPCX1124*#*We will need to cut down some of the palm trees to make the crosses. Get a sharp saw and a few axes. And be careful not to get hit by a falling coconut.
SPCX1125*#*The crosses are finished. All we need now is to erect them on the hills. On this occasion I decided to name the Island in honor of the Spanish King, Island of St. Carlos.
SPCX1126*#*The main hill is quite steep. Some stairs would be helpful. Try to cut them from the stones lying around here. Make sure the steps are stable, we do not want to fall from there.
SPCX1127*#*Good, now everything is ready. Call a few strong sailors to help us carry the crosses uphill. Some of them can dig out the holes in the ground where we can place the crosses.
SPCX1128*#*Done! I hope they will last a few years at least. Now we can admire our work while we eat something tasty. I saw good looking fish in the waters off the east coast.
SPCX1129*#*It’s time to move on. We have still large expanses of ocean to explore. The cargo hold of our ships is not full yet. We can take more of the moai if the natives have finished some.
SPCX113*#*The stone cutters have already managed to eat all of their cocoa supplies. They would love to buy some more if you have it in your stock.
SPCX1130*#*Well then, it’s time I took my leave. I want to ask you one last favor. Lend me some money. My boss can see only gold when it comes to treasures. He would be angry if I returned without some.
SPCX1131*#*Have you enjoyed your time on the Easter Island? I have been sailing through the Pacific, but luck has not been kind to me. My anchor is completely rusty, and that’s not all.
SPCX1132*#*My flagship got wrecked near a coral island. My other ships got scratched by the rocks too. I managed to patch them up, but they will need to be repaired properly soon.
SPCX1133*#*We have discovered quite a few islands, but still no sign of the great southern continent. The food is sparse, and the mood is low. Let’s give the men a break on the nearest island to recuperate.
SPCX1134*#*I have planted a few of the Holland tulips from home on some islands. Go check how they are doing. I am curious if they grow well in this tropical climate.
SPCX1135*#*I will go look around for something to eat. You can help my men build the camp. But keep your eyes open. Many of these islands are inhabited by unfriendly savages.
SPCX1136*#*We did not find enough fruit in the forest. I left a few men to look for more food, they will arrive later. We will have to catch some fish for dinner tonight.
SPCX1137*#*Do you hear it? These are the sounds of fighting coming from the forest. It must be the men I left to search for food. It looks like they are in trouble. Hurry up, they need our help!
SPCX1138*#*I really dislike fighting. But sometimes you can’t avoid it. Let’s look if the natives had something we might use and leave. There might be more of them.
SPCX1139*#*We need to return to Europe now, although the search for the southern continent was unsuccessful. We don’t have much supplies anymore, and our ships are not in a good state either.
SPCX114*#*The town needs more wood to build the bell-house. The architects have totally miscalculated the materials. It seems like you’re slowly going to build the whole town!
SPCX1140*#*We have to head west into the territory of the East India Company. I hope they won’t mind us breaching their waters without assent. Take some of the tulips, it might soften their Dutch hearts.
SPCX1141*#*There is a barricade of the East India ships. I think they want to catch us. Let’s try to outrun them around the cliffs. If you can get some rocks to block their path, we might escape them.
SPCX1142*#*They caught us. These waters are their territory, there are just too many of their ships. Tell your crew to get on deck and give up their weapons. We will have to surrender.
SPCX1143*#*I still can’t believe they took us prisoners. At least you are free, don’t know how you managed that. They are taking us to Batavia. The food is horrible. Can you smuggle us some grilled fish?
SPCX1144*#*Go to Netherlands and get my lawyer. He will want some advance payment, so have some gold with you. I will return it to you once I am free again, I promise.
SPCX1145*#*The company seized my ships and cargo. They will bring me back to Netherlands, where the trial will take place. At least I will be home again. You can offer to transport the iron ore I was carrying.
SPCX1146*#*It’s good of you to still stand by me. Please take care of my crew while I am locked up. They will need to get a ship to return home. I believe you can find one or two.
SPCX1147*#*Bring my wife some tulips and tell her I send them. She loves those flowers. They will make her feel a bit better while waiting for me. I know she must be worried sick.
SPCX1148*#*The trial is going well. I am quite sure we will win this. I promised my wife to build a new house for her once I am back from the voyage. I think you can start preparing the material.
SPCX1149*#*It could not have gone better. I am free again, my wife is happy, and the East India have to pay reparations to me and my men. Will you help bring the gold to them?
SPCX115*#*The church is almost ready but there’s still one thing missing. A church bell! The iron supplies have been insufficient lately… Will you sort it out?
SPCX1150*#*It’s time we part our ways. Let’s finish this with a nice get together with my crew. Then I will have to take care of my family. My wife will not let me go on another adventure anytime soon.
SPCX1151*#*Exploring the ocean, captain? I am on a voyage of discovery too. We will surely meet again. I will have three riddles for you. If you answer me correctly, you might win some shiny gems.
SPCX1152*#*You know it as the Easter Island, but I heard the natives call it by a different name. Do you know it? Write it down so you remember, when the time comes to answer my questions.
SPCX1153*#*The ocean is far and wide, it’s easy to get lost. I am leaving a wooden cross on each island I visit, so when I come again I will know that I was here before. I advise you do the same.
SPCX1154*#*There are many fish in the sea. Yet none swim into my fishing net. I have had enough of stale bread and salted meat, I want to eat something fresh.
SPCX1155*#*That vicious storm almost ripped us to shreds. I am glad we are still alive, but our ship suffered some serious damage. We might manage to repair her if you can get us some nails.
SPCX1156*#*Something bad happened. One of my men fell overboard and drowned. Such are the perils of life on the sea. Will you help me build him a proper grave on the beach?
SPCX1157*#*I heard there is a treasure hidden on this island. I will share it with you if you lend me a shovel and a pickaxe. The ground is hard as stone here.
SPCX1158*#*Come, join me at my campfire. The nights are quite cold here. We will need more wood to make the fire burn until morning.
SPCX1159*#*I can’t get the strange statues we saw on the Easter Island out of my head. I have tried to reproduce them before, but I don’t remember the details well. Will you help me?
SPCX116*#*My new ship is almost ready! Now, we have to pay the main architect. Will you help me? I’ll give you the money back as soon as my ships return from Rome.
SPCX1160*#*Fresh fruit is always scarce on a ship. But this island has a lot of oranges. We should take as many as we can. If you lend me some crates I will share them with you.
SPCX1161*#*The chain on our anchor is getting rusty. We should quickly replace it with a new one before we lose the anchor. You have been very resourceful until now, can you help?
SPCX1162*#*The reef here is made of a spectacular marble. I know the sculptors back in Europe would love it. I will try to take some, you go around the island and look for more.
SPCX1163*#*Do you think the seagulls taste good? I miss some tender chicken meat. Maybe they taste similar. We could lure the birds with some fish.
SPCX1164*#*Strong wind has damaged one of our sails. We will need to buy a new one in Batavia. Do you know who named this ocean the Pacific? It is not peaceful at all.
SPCX1165*#*We have a problem. There are some rotten planks on the first deck. One sailor already fell through the hole and broke his leg. It needs to be repaired asap.
SPCX1166*#*We have spent the night on this island. When we woke up all our weapons were gone. We are lucky that nobody was killed, but we have no means to defend ourselves now.
SPCX1167*#*Keep this to yourself, but I think my crew is considering mutiny. They are unhappy we are so long at sea without any significant discoveries. Do you think some money would make them happy?
SPCX1168*#*Our supplies are dwindling. Who knows how long we will be out here. Even if we decide to turn back and return home, it would take us weeks to to get there.
SPCX1169*#*The coconuts growing on this island are delicious. The only problem is how to get them. I can’t climb these palm trees. We will have to cut them down. If only we had some axes.
SPCX117*#*Blacksmiths urgently need wood. They burnt all of their supplies when they were making the church bell. They said that they would reward you with iron.
SPCX1170*#*There is nothing on these small islands. But once we arrive in East India I will buy as much spice as I can pay for and take it back home. This voyage must be profitable.
SPCX1171*#*I have come to the shore on a small boat. But it’s gone now. Someone must have taken it. I can feel the eyes of the savages looking at us from the bushes. Let’s hurry back to the ships.
SPCX1172*#*The weather is terrible. We need to wait here until the storm blows over. Will you help us build some shelter? There will be a place for you too.
SPCX1173*#*So you say Jacob Roggeveen, a Dutch explorer, was on the Easter Island before me? Do you know the name of his ship? I think a ship is at least as important as her captain.
SPCX1174*#*I need your help, captain. I have inspected our supplies today and found out our barrels with drinking water are leaking. We need new barrels before everything leaks out.
SPCX1175*#*Do you know how much this voyage cost me? A fortune! I can only hope I will find some precious treasure otherwise I will be drowning in debts. You would help me if you could, right?
SPCX1176*#*I have found this strange chest while exploring, but it’s locked. I can’t open whatever I try. There must be some key nearby. Try looking here: @Fan Page@https://www.facebook.com/Seaportgame/@
SPCX1177*#*Where do you come from? Are you from Spain too? Which ever country you hail from, I am sure we can become friends. Come, I will show you around my farm.
SPCX1178*#*I grow here some crops, and breed mainly pigs. However, it’s not as prosperous as I hoped. I have made quite a few debts already. If you could lend me some money, I will surely return it.
SPCX1179*#*You are very kind to help me repay the debts. I assure you I will pay it all off to you together with the interests. If you and your men have time, I could also use help with the work around the farm.
SPCX118*#*Our school has been open for almost 1 year! We’re preparing a great ceremony for all the students and sailors. You, our main sponsor, can’t be missing!
SPCX1180*#*Actually, I am an explorer. I have little experiences with farming, maybe that’s why my farming adventure is not very successful. Enough talking. Now let’s repair the pig shed before the pigs run away.
SPCX1181*#*I spoke to my investors today. Seems the interest has increased my debt to ridiculous heights. I don’t even have money for food now. I will have to disappear from here.
SPCX1182*#*You are a captain, you say? I would never endanger you by hiding on your ship. And I have already found the perfect escape route. But I will have to hide in a barrel.
SPCX1183*#*Leave the pigs some grapes, they love them. It shall be my goodbye gift for them. But I can’t leave my Leoncico here. I hope you found a barrel big enough for me and my dog.
SPCX1184*#*I am lucky I got to the continent at all. When captain Ensico discovered me, he wanted to leave me stranded. But the situation here looks dangerous. You better keep your men close.
SPCX1185*#*Mr. Pizarro, the supervisor of this colony, says they were constantly attacked by the native tribes. I hope you have some weapons. I worry that we can expect another attack soon.
SPCX1186*#*This was the third attack in two days. We need to leave this place. I suggest we move westward to the jungle. If we tell Ensico and Pizarro that there is gold, they will surely want to go there.
SPCX1187*#*They agreed to move the settlement where I suggested. We should start packing now. You take care of the food supplies and I will help with the building and farming tools.
SPCX1188*#*Of course there is a clan living here too. There must be at least 500 native warriors. But don’t worry, I am sure we will defeat them. If you don’t want to fight, ready the material for the houses.
SPCX1189*#*But we are no cruel monsters, so let the captives go. They know now how dangerous we are, so they will avoid us. Now we can open a bottle of wine and celebrate our victory.
SPCX119*#*Unbelievable! The town has decided to build us statues on the main square! They said that we deserve it. They only need some good stone supplies.
SPCX1190*#*This place here is ideal for a new settlement. You have already brought some stone, but we will need wood too. A new settlement deserves a new name and it shall be Santa Maria.
SPCX1191*#*We have found some golden ornaments in the village of the natives. The men are like crazy looking for more gold. If you want some of it, you should send your sailors searching too.
SPCX1192*#*Have you found some gold? You know we must share it between each other? So that everyone in the settlement gets his part. I hope you understand that.
SPCX1193*#*Seems the people really like me. They choose me to be their governor. The thing I want to concentrate on is exploration. But with so many native tribes here, we will need to be well armed.
SPCX1194*#*I want to make a large feast for the whole settlement to thank them for choosing me as the new governor. Help me prepare some food. I am not a good cook, nor hunter or fisherman.
SPCX1195*#*Before we leave to explore the land, let’s plant the grape vine near the settlement. The earth is rich and fertile here. It should grow well. I can't wait to taste the fruits already.
SPCX1196*#*The local chieftain Careta wants to become our ally. He promises to supply us with food if we help them rebuild their houses, which were destroyed in the battle. That’s not a bad deal.
SPCX1197*#*Careta told us about another sea to the south across the land. We can sail down the river. It will make the crossing easier. But our ships are not made to sail shallow rivers. We need new ones.
SPCX1198*#*I wrote a letter to the king of Spain asking for more men. We will need more soldiers to guard the land we have already won. And some carpenters and builders to build a shipyard.
SPCX1199*#*Don’t take me for a greedy man, but gold is power. We need it to spread Spain’s influence around the world. You wouldn’t keep it just for yourself, if you found some, right?
SPCX120*#*My ship is already under construction! We need to get some wood for the masts. You’re a wood expert so I count on you.
SPCX1200*#*The natives told us that there is so much gold in the land to the south that the people eat from golden plates. Let’s hurry up with the building of ships and shipyard, so we can go there soon.
SPCX1201*#*We are setting off soon. Careta’s men will join us. They know this land and will guide us through the jungle. Let’s have a tasty meal before we get underway.
SPCX1202*#*We are entering a territory of a dangerous clan. It’s not wise to underestimate these warriors. Be ready to anchor the boats when they attack, it would be no use to try and flee. We must fight.
SPCX1203*#*That was a tough fight. We lost a lot of men, but we must go on. Careta said when we cross this mountain range, we will see the south sea. Let’s drink something before we go on.
SPCX1204*#*We found a lot of pearls in the last village. The natives say they come from the isles in the bay. We had to leave our boats upstream, so we need to build new ones to reach the islands.
SPCX1205*#*Send your men to look for more pearls. If we can’t find gold, pearls are good too. But be ready to meet the natives. These are densely inhabited lands.
SPCX1206*#*We have obviously lost the way. Which fool thought the pearl clams will be inside the forest? Try asking the locals to tell us how to get back to the beach. Some gold might make them friendly.
SPCX1207*#*At last we are back at the seashore. Let’s return to the mainland. It’s time I claimed this sea for the Spanish kingdom. We will leave there a text etched in stone, which will mark our discovery.
SPCX1208*#*Now it’s time to return to Santa Maria. I want to take a different route back to explore more area. We should plan the way back during dinner, so we can get on the road tomorrow.
SPCX1209*#*Let’s delve into the jungle again. Watch out for the poisonous snakes. One bite and you are dead. It’s best to just cut off their head with your sword, before they get to strike.
SPCX121*#*My ships have returned from Rome and they have sold all the cocoa! People over there can turn it into something very tasty. They call it “chocolate”.
SPCX1210*#*It seems the settlement flourished while we were gone. Our soldiers have protected it, the crops are growing well, even the first harvest was plentiful. Let’s taste the fruits of our labor.
SPCX1211*#*We must send a ship with the news of our discovery to the king together with a part of the treasure. Is one of the ships ready for a voyage across the ocean?
SPCX1212*#*I need you here to help me around the settlement and with further exploration of the land. But send some reliable men with the treasure back to Spain. We don’t want it to get lost on the way.
SPCX1213*#*Have you loaded a part of your treasure on the ship? We must give the crown one fifth of everything we obtain here. That’s the deal. We can still keep quite a lot, you won’t become poor.
SPCX1214*#*Now, that the ship is on it’s way to Spain, we can concentrate on improving the settlement. Once the winter is over, I plan to go exploring once again. We should finish the rebuilding until then.
SPCX1215*#*Ships from Spain have arrived. They bring the men and supplies I requested from the king. Let’s prepare a dinner for them and have a talk with their leader Mr. Avila. He brings some news.
SPCX1216*#*The news were bad. Avila is here to replace me as the new governor. Someone has complained about me and convinced the king that I am trying to make a fortune for myself. Pour me some wine.
SPCX1217*#*People like me here. Avila won’t have it easy trying to command them. And I certainly won’t help him. Not after he took away all my weapons to prevent a mutiny. How am I to go exploring now?
SPCX1218*#*There are just too many people here. We need to find a new location for another settlement. I asked the new governor for his leave to go exploring. I hope you and your men are coming too.
SPCX1219*#*This cedar wood is perfect for shipbuilding. We will sail along the coast and look out for a convenient place for a settlement. I want to avoid the jungle if I can.
SPCX122*#*My new ship will take the first cruise soon! I just need a few coins for the authorities who will approve it. If you lend me a bit of money, I’ll pay you back as soon as I can!
SPCX1220*#*We have been exploring for many days, but haven't found a safe place for a settlement. I even conceded to going through the jungle. I don't want to get back empty handed, let's look for some gold at least.
SPCX1221*#*I always prefer making friends with the natives to fighting them. But that is not always an option. On this expedition it goes wrong all the time. I think I am bleeding, I need some rest and food.
SPCX1222*#*We need to return. The natives are following us. I have lost too many men, we can’t face them anymore. Try to start a stone avalanche on the hill nearby. That should stop them.
SPCX1223*#*At last we are back in the settlement. I will need some time to heal my wounds, but I have already planned the next expedition. But first, bring me some wine to calm my nerves.
SPCX1224*#*I want to explore the South Sea next. Who knows what riches are waiting there for us. I already send a ship to Cuba to recruit the men stationed there, but we will probably need more.
SPCX1225*#*The last expedition proved how dangerous these lands can be. We must be prepared for more attacks by the locals. This time I am not going to let them get the better of us.
SPCX1226*#*The new governor would not approve this expedition after what happened the last time. You must buy all the supplies we will need. Nobody can suspect that I am preparing to leave.
SPCX1227*#*The governor found out about the expedition, and now wants to lock me up in a wooden cage. How could he have found out? It was not from you, was it?
SPCX1228*#*Where did the governor get so much wood for the cage so quickly? You did not help him, I hope. Fortunately, our bishop persuaded him not to lock me up. Let’s eat something, I am starving.
SPCX1229*#*It won’t be easy to go exploring now, but don’t think I gave up. I must go help with the house repairs as the governor commanded, but meanwhile I will think of a new plan.
SPCX123*#*The architects have designed a beautiful treasure chest. I’d be glad if they could enhance our new ship too. I’m sure you’ll like it.
SPCX1230*#*I will drink with the governor tonight. After he falls asleep we will get onto the boats and leave unseen. In the morning his head will hurt so much he won’t think about looking for me.
SPCX1231*#*Good that I have such a high tolerance for wine. Still I had to drink quite a lot till the governor passed out. Help me get on the boat. I hope all our men are ready to set off.
SPCX1232*#*Chain the remaining boats to the pier so they can’t go after us. That will win us some more time. Let’s hope they decide not to pursue us at all after finding the chained boats.
SPCX1233*#*When we get down the river, we will need to build new ships to explore the sea. These boats are not made for the open water. Look, if you can spot the cedar trees along the river as we pass by.
SPCX1234*#*We met Mr. Pizarro in the jungle. It was he who locked me up. Again he accuses me of conspiring against our king and taking all the gold for myself. Just bring me some food for now.
SPCX1235*#*Don’t worry, I will be fine. They have to release me soon. These accusations are ridiculous. But you can try to bribe them so they let me go sooner.
SPCX1236*#*I am sure all will end well. But I will understand if you leave now. It would be stupid to let them lock us up both. So good luck, captain. And be careful on your further explorations.
SPCX1237*#*...to the ancient city of Rome. You must have heard of me, I am Julius Caesar, the leader of Rome’s army. I have a business proposal for you. Let’s talk it through over a light lunch.
SPCX1238*#*I am planning a military expedition to the north and west. I have the capable Roman soldiers to fight for me on land, but we will need a back up from sea once we get to the English Channel.
SPCX1239*#*Building a fleet that will carry all our soldiers to the British Islands will be expensive. I am prepared to get as much money as possible, but you will have to pay something too.
SPCX124*#*Is this what happens when we’re so close to finishing the ship?! Could you do something about it? I’ll be really thankful!
SPCX1240*#*While I am gone my fellow senators Crassus and Pompeius will take care of the issues at home. Renovating the city and taking care of our people will be their responsibility.
SPCX1241*#*I will be taking the route through the continent. You take your ships and meet me at the west coast of Gaul. Look out for my messenger. He will know you by the laurel wreath, so don’t forget it.
SPCX1242*#*My friend, we are at the shore of the river Rhine. We need to build a bridge across. If you can, come and help us with the materials. We are awaiting you.
SPCX1243*#*You are here at last. I hope you did not encounter any trouble on the way. The bridge is almost finished. We need only a few more planks to make it more stable.
SPCX1244*#*Some of my soldiers are injured from the clashes with the local tribes. They can’t go any further. Find them place on your ships and take them home. I will cross the land with the rest of my men.
SPCX1245*#*Are you ready to cross the channel? The Britons are fierce warriors. Let’s rest for a few days before we attack the islands. Food will replenish our energy.
SPCX1246*#*Stay with the ships while I proceed with my men inland. Make sure you and your sailors are armed. And always be on guard. This is enemy territory.
SPCX1247*#*I have returned right after I learned that our ships were damaged. How many have we lost? We need to repair what we can fast, before the Britons realize we are trapped here.
SPCX1248*#*Too many ships are damaged beyond repair. We need to send a messenger back to Rome to send us more ships. Choose a few men who will go and give them the wreaths as a sign of safe passage.
SPCX1249*#*We need some allies from among the locals. Money can be very persuasive. I have already arranged a meeting with a leader of one of the lesser tribes. We only need to prepare the gift for him.
SPCX125*#*The ironworkers would like to thank you for the wood you’ve provided them with. They’re inviting you for a dinner. Will you come?
SPCX1250*#*We won as I knew we would. We will build here a memorial to our loyal soldiers who gave their lives to ensure our victory. A general would be nothing without his soldiers.
SPCX1251*#*Crassus is dead and Pompeius tries to grab all the power for himself. We need to return to Rome immediately. Take half my men with you by sea, I will cross the river Rubicon with one of my legions.
SPCX1252*#*Pompeius is trying to flee. That coward. If he thinks I will just let him escape, he is wrong. Resupply while we are in Rome and let’s pursue him.
SPCX1253*#*The people of Rome need a good and just ruler and I will give them one. Even Pompeius will have a fair trial. We will put him in chains and bring him back to Rome once we catch him.
SPCX1254*#*Pompeius took quite an army of supporters with him. He won’t give up peacefully that’s for sure. But I have one ace up my sleeve, the war carriages will ensure our victory.
SPCX1255*#*The laurel wreath I wear marks my previous martial victories over the Gauls and savages from the north. But I feel it signifies also our coming victory over Pompeius.
SPCX1256*#*While I fight this battle, return with your men to Rome and make sure that Marcus Antonius has everything under control there. I trust him, but I would be calmer if you check on him.
SPCX1257*#*Pompeius escaped again. I need to ensure that I am elected as consul again. That will take some persuasion and gold too. Once this is done we will pursue him again.
SPCX1258*#*I would accept Pompeius’s apology if he only could agree to share power with me. He was the husband of my only daughter Julia before she died. He is family and that is important.
SPCX1259*#*Pompeius fled to Egypt. Is your fleet ready? We have need of it now. Fill your ships with food for the voyage and let’s go before we lose his trail.
SPCX126*#*If you provide me with high-quality wood, I’ll get us beautiful captain desks. They will be even more beautiful than those from Columbus!
SPCX1260*#*These are tumultuous times in Egypt too. I don’t expect any fighting, but it’s better to be ready for a less than warm welcome, especially if they have allied themselves with Pompeius.
SPCX1261*#*We have been invited into the pharaoh’s palace. We must stick together and show them our unity. Wear the wreath I gave you, it will profess your loyalty to me. Give them also to your men.
SPCX1262*#*Killed by the pharaoh’s assassins. This is not how I wanted it to end. I am going to rest for the evening. Send some of my men to stand watch before my chamber. I don’t trust these people.
SPCX1263*#*I want his killers dead. He might have been a power hungry man, but he was family. I want him avenged. The men who did this will hang. Have the gallows constructed on the square.
SPCX1264*#*I had an interesting visitor tonight. The exiled Queen Cleopatra invited herself into my chambers. Disguised in a roll of carpet. Ask about her in the city and don’t hesitate to pay for good information.
SPCX1265*#*I decided to help Cleopatra win the throne for herself. I asked her to dine with me to go over the plans. I heard she loves a special kind of fish. Could you fetch it for me?
SPCX1266*#*I trust you fully, that’s why I want to ask you a big favour. Stay here with Cleopatra and look out for her, but also inform me should you hear anything suspicious. Choose a safe house in the city.
SPCX1267*#*Captain, it’s a pleasure. Caesar told me many things about you. I am sure our relationship will be mutually beneficial. But let me warn you, I am a demanding master.
SPCX1268*#*I have your first task for you. I noticed Caesar’s men wear these wonderful sandals. I always demanded that my servants are tastefully dressed. They need to have these sandals too.
SPCX1269*#*Don’t think I am unaware of why you are really here. Caesar wants you to spy on me. Don’t worry, I am not conspiring against him. I need his help to regain the throne. Your help is welcome too.
SPCX127*#*The jeweller would like to know, if you could bring him some of your precious stone. He said that this should be the last time and that he’d give you a break afterwards.
SPCX1270*#*My brother and husband is just a child. He knows nothing about ruling and what the people of Egypt need. Right now many need to repair their houses destroyed by a gale that passed through the city.
SPCX1271*#*Yes, my brother is my husband. Such is the tradition in the royal family. The tradition is also that the ruler is male, even if he is a spoiled child. I will need an army to win the throne.
SPCX1272*#*An essential thing needed by everyone is food. There are many beggars starving on the streets of Alexandria. But their queen does not forget them even while in exile.
SPCX1273*#*Caesar is getting ready for the battle with my brother. Once he defeats him we can start the renovation of the palace. I always wanted a bigger throne room.
SPCX1274*#*Our warriors are used to fight almost naked. But I see that the helmets Romans wear are useful. Can we make some for our soldiers before the battle starts?
SPCX1275*#*Caesar won the battle. The Roman soldiers really are unbeatable. Now we can celebrate our victory and my return to the throne. Hire the best musicians and order the finest food.
SPCX1276*#*The metal helmets have proven to be a good choice of attire for my soldiers. Let’s equip them fully in the Roman fashion including armor and sandals.
SPCX1277*#*Caesar is returning back to Rome. He is in the harbor boarding the ships with his men. He did not even say goodbye to me properly. Prepare my carriage so I can go remedy it.
SPCX1278*#*Caesar has helped me regain my crown, but now that he has left I am afraid my enemies will try to remove me again. Are your sailors any good with a sword?
SPCX1279*#*I plan to have a statue made by a sculptor from Greece. It will display me and Caesar as a sign of the good relationship between Egypt and Rome. It will be cut from marble of the highest quality.
SPCX128*#*Our roads are slowly splitting. We should celebrate it like true successful navigators!
SPCX1280*#*I will reveal a secret to you. I am expecting Caesar’s child. I want this to be a surprise. So keep it to yourself. Now go and tell the servants I am ready to dine. After all, I am eating for two now.
SPCX1281*#*My little Caesar will be born soon. I want only the best for him. A beautiful golden crib, the best toys, and softest clothes. He will become the ruler of both Egypt and Rome once.
SPCX1282*#*Caesarion is healthy and strong. I want to go to Rome with him when he is a bit older and can endure the voyage. You make sure I have a fleet worthy of the new ruler of the Mediterranean.
SPCX1283*#*My guards must be armed properly. Nothing can endanger my son on his way to meet his father and claim his rightful position as Caesar’s sole heir.
SPCX1284*#*All who will accompany me must be dressed in their best clothes. Everyone in Rome will be astounded by the beauty and elegance of the Queen of Egypt and her entourage.
SPCX1285*#*Caesarion is now old enough to travel to Rome. I hope everything is ready for the voyage just as I requested. Get your men aboard and let’s set sail for Rome.
SPCX1286*#*Don’t you think Caesar looked happy when I introduced him our son? It’s a shame I have to stay in his country house. It’s not furnished properly. I need a large marble tub to take my daily bath.
SPCX1287*#*While I am here I want to go explore the city and market. I heard you can buy exquisite cloth and perfumes in Rome. But we will buy only the products of the highest quality.
SPCX1288*#*Caesar will come and dine with us today. You remember the fish I like so much? I trust you can find them in Rome too. Make sure they are fresh.
SPCX1289*#*Caesar had a golden statue of me raised in the Temple of Venus. I must see it with my own eyes. Prepare a coach for me and my son. We will go there tomorrow in the morning.
SPCX129*#*Maybe you could leave me here some cocoa before you leave. I’ve really got used to it! The new ship will be ready next week. See you there!
SPCX1290*#*My servants bought a lot of olive oil on the market. But the clay amphorae are too fragile to endure the voyage back to Egypt. Look for something that will not break so easily.
SPCX1291*#*I have heard some unsettling rumours from Caesar’s servants. I need to find out what is going on. I will send out a few spies disguised as locals into the city. Help them get inside unnoticed.
SPCX1292*#*Caesar is beloved by the people, but other senators conspire against him. I did not manage to find out what they are planning, but he needs to be more careful. Can you send your men to protect him?
SPCX1293*#*My relationship with Caesar is a public secret and it has made me many enemies. Even Caesar’s supporters resent me because he cheated on his wife with me. Hire more guards for me so I will feel safer.
SPCX1294*#*I purchased some Roman marble statues from the local sculptor. Can you transport them to my ships so they are ready when we leave for home?
SPCX1295*#*A messenger came from the city. Caesar was murdered in the senate. I was afraid this would happen. Take the necessities and let’s leave before somebody sends assassins after me too.
SPCX1296*#*I am leaving now. I suspect tumultuous times will come to Rome after Caesar’s death. Pack all my things into crates and send them to me. I would hate to lose it all.
SPCX1297*#*I have received a messenger from Marcus Antonius, Caesar’s old friend and successor. Rome is in civil war. They seek my support to defeat Caesar’s murderers. Let’s send them some weapons for now.
SPCX1298*#*I must decide how far I am willing to get involved in this war. Bring me some figs from the market. I need something sweet to help me think this through.
SPCX1299*#*Marcus Antonius is coming for a personal visit. Help me prepare to welcome him in style. Take the cloth I bought in Rome to the best tailor in town and tell him to make me a stunning dress.
SPCX130*#*We’ve built a new school, caught the thieves, built up the town and got prestigious awards. Thank you my friend, it was a marvellous journey! Just a little more wood and the special reward is yours!
SPCX1300*#*I will join this war. But don’t think it’s only because I was charmed by the handsome Marcus Antonius. I want to fight for the legacy of my son. We will gather our soldiers and go to the battlefield.
SPCX1301*#*In Caesar’s last will he has named his nephew Octavian his sole heir. But the only true heir of Caesar is my son. I had commissioned a new statue made, me and my son as the gods Isis and Horus.
SPCX1302*#*I am rational woman, but sometimes my heart takes over too. I will marry Marcus Antonius and we will live here in Alexandria together. I can’t wait to be his, so let’s start planning the wedding feast.
SPCX1303*#*It seems Marcus Antonius has made many enemies in Rome. Many resent him for living here with me. But I know Octavian is behind this, he wants to usurp all power for himself as Caesar’s heir.
SPCX1304*#*Octavian has declared war upon us. He is afraid that my son will one day rule Rome and Egypt. And it is a way to get rid of Marcus Antonius. Let’s prepare our fleet to meet him at Actium.
SPCX1305*#*I can’t believe we lost. Pay the smugglers to get us out of the city before Octavian gets here. What is the noise from outside? Marcus Antonius is before the gates, he is bleeding.
SPCX1306*#*Marcus Antonius is dead and Octavian will soon be in my palace to take me prisoner. He will not get me alive. Smuggle an asp into my chambers. Hide it in a basket of figs.
SPCX1307*#*Captain, for a word if you can. I am Octavian, Caesar’s grandnephew and his heir. It’s sad our first meeting has to be at Caesar’s funeral. Have you already presented your parting gift for his tomb?
SPCX1308*#*I know you have also business elsewhere. But as his friend, I am sure, you would like to see his killers brought to justice. There will be some fighting involved, but I need you for the logistics.
SPCX1309*#*Caesar’s killers fled Rome. We will have to wait for the right opportunity to get them. In the meantime, I plan to host games in Caesar’s memory. Let’s build the auditorium first.
SPCX131*#*Hello, I am Ming Zhou, a merchant from the Far East. I am looking for a partner to help me organize a great event. How about we discuss this over some fancy dinner?
SPCX1310*#*We still need to get some food. We will honor Caesar’s memory and give the people what they want at the same time - bread and games. If we don’t have bread, fish will do too.
SPCX1311*#*I asked Marcus Antonius, Caesar’s colleague, to give me the money I inherited, but he refused. I will need to sell some marble statues from my house to get the funds for the planned games.
SPCX1312*#*Marcus Antonius is complicating things for me again. Now he prevented my election as the new tribune. I need to get more people on my side to gain some advantage.
SPCX1313*#*Marcus Antonius has illegally occupied one Roman province and the senate sent me to capture him. Now I can pay him back for his behavior. But we will need to hire more soldiers to win.
SPCX1314*#*It was a tough fight, but the victory is mine. Now I can proudly wear the laurel wreath just like Caesar did. I know the senate will pardon Antonius, but at least he knows not to mess with me again.
SPCX1315*#*We will form a second triumvirate with Marcus Antonius and Lepidus. It will be difficult to work with him now, but we have to lay down our weapons. At least for now.
SPCX1316*#*We have joined our forces to punish Caesar’s killers. That is our common cause and I hope it will be stronger than the mutual animosity. We will discuss the next steps tomorrow at lunch.
SPCX1317*#*We have found the main conspirators against Caesar, Brutus and Cassius. They are hiding with their soldiers in Greece. Let’s get together a fleet and go after them.
SPCX1318*#*The Roman foot soldiers are unbeatable. But among the marines we have strong competition in the Greeks and the Egyptians. Lend us some of your seasoned sailors for this battle.
SPCX1319*#*We can celebrate another victory. Caesar’s murder is avenged. When we defeated their army, Brutus and Cassius have taken their lives to avoid a just punishment. Traitors and cowards.
SPCX132*#*As you might know we are nearing the Chinese New Year. This calls for some magnificent celebrations. I will need a trustworthy partner. Is it gonna be you?
SPCX1320*#*Antonius is claiming all credit for the defeat of Brutus and Cassius for himself. I can never have a good relationship with that man. To spite him I will have a victorious statue built in my honor.
SPCX1321*#*We have divided the Roman lands between the three of us. Lepidus is in Africa and Antonius ran to Egypt to his lover Cleopatra. I have the rest and the difficult task of rewarding the veterans.
SPCX1322*#*I am going to make one last attempt at befriending Antonius. I have a sister in the age for marriage. If Antonius would marry her, it might help our relations. I sent her with a dowry to Egypt.
SPCX1323*#*Marcus Antonius has refused my sister. This is the last insult I will suffer from him! I know already how to turn the senate against him. Prepare some refreshments, we will have a long meeting.
SPCX1324*#*The senate has officially declared war on Cleopatra and revoked Antonius’s consulship. The lovebirds are in Greece, let’s go greet them with our fleet and see who will be the victor this time.
SPCX1325*#*We need to prepare the soldiers for a naval battle. Metal armor could easily pull them to the sea bottom. They should wear only leather sandals and light armor.
SPCX1326*#*We have blocked their way back to Egypt. Antonius and Cleopatra don’t have many soldiers here and even some of Antonius’s troops are changing sides and joining our ranks as we speak.
SPCX1327*#*Both Antonius and Cleopatra managed to slip through the naval blockade and fled to Egypt. I have spies in Alexandria. For a few coins they will make sure our enemies won’t get any further.
SPCX1328*#*Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra died before I got to the palace. I have ordered that a tomb shall be built for them outside of Alexandria. They were my enemies, but I still respect them.
SPCX1329*#*It’s time to return to Rome. Great things are just waiting for us. I need a bit rest before I meet the senate. Will you join me for a dinner on my ship?
SPCX133*#*The New Year will be coming soon and we should start with the preparations as soon as possible. So let’s get us some supplies!
SPCX1330*#*I plan to give up the provinces under my control. It shouldn’t be for long. There is hardly any competent commander left in Rome. In the meantime I will concentrate on the restoration of our fleet.
SPCX1331*#*The senate has asked me to oversee most of Rome’s provinces. Moreover, I have now 20 legions under me. We need to ensure all our legionaries are well equipped to keep the Roman Empire safe.
SPCX1332*#*Weapons are important, but our soldiers should be dressed properly as well. The larger part of Rome’s army is under my command now. I will not neglect this responsibility.
SPCX1333*#*I can’t take care of all the provinces by myself. I have assigned a senator to oversee each province. Do you have a few men I can trust to accompany the senators to their new home?
SPCX1334*#*Now that I have access to my full inheritance, we can invest in some building projects in Rome. I have a concept for a new temple, it will be called the Pantheon.
SPCX1335*#*During the times of unrest people knew me as Octavian. But now, that the civil wars are over, we face a bright future. As a sign of that I need a new name. From now on call me Augustus.
SPCX1336*#*You have helped me greatly and now I have all I need to lead Rome to glory. Join me for dinner tonight so I can say goodbye to you properly. Rest assured that Rome is in good hands.
SPCX1337*#*I hear you are a competent captain. I might have a job for you. Help us build the new docks now and then we can talk about a special mission. It will be worth your time, I promise.
SPCX1338*#*I am Commodore Matthew Perry. I am preparing a fleet of steamships for a voyage to the far East. We are still missing a few screws here and there and the ships will be finished.
SPCX1339*#*We have an important mission from president Fillmore himself. We need to establish business relations with Japan. Even though we have a lot to offer them, don’t expect it to be easy.
SPCX134*#*The decorations are an essential part of the festivities. We will need some red paint and paper to bring the color of good fortune to our house.
SPCX1340*#*The problem with steamers is that they need a lot of coal. We will load as much coal here as we can carry, but we will have to resupply along the way anyway.
SPCX1341*#*We have the fuel for the ships, but we also need some food for our sailors. The steamers can carry a large cargo, but a lot of space will be taken up by the coal.
SPCX1342*#*I have read up a lot of information about Japan to get ready for this mission. My sailors should know what to expect too. Talk about it to your men, it will be easier than giving them big tomes.
SPCX1343*#*Rice is very common in Asia. Slowly it’s gaining popularity in Europe and America too. I personally prefer potatoes, but rice is nutritious and does not get spoiled easily.
SPCX1344*#*I will be commanding the Mississippi. It is a fine steamer but I heard the technicians complain about some issue with her steam engine. Will you check if we can help with something?
SPCX1345*#*There are several stops planned on the voyage before we arrive in our final destination. We will need some funds to buy food and coal along the way.
SPCX1346*#*I must go meet the president. He will give me the letter for the Japanese government. It is an offer to start trading between our countries. In the meantime, you can help build the new docks again.
SPCX1347*#*I have the letter from the president safely locked up in my cabin and so we are ready to set off. Let’s get the last few supply crates aboard and we can set sail.
SPCX1348*#*Our next stop will be in Hong Kong. There we will take the sinologist Mr. Williams aboard. He will help us communicate with the Japanese. They are using the same signs as the Chinese.
SPCX1349*#*I wish we could do this peacefully, but we must be ready to use force if necessary. Do we have enough ammunition for the cannons? If not, now is the chance to get some.
SPCX135*#*Before we can start we need to clean up all this mess. Hire some help so we can get it done faster.
SPCX1350*#*The steamer Susquehanna will join our fleet at Shanghai. We will stop there shortly. Let’s use this chance to get some food. Our crew has eaten almost all our supplies already.
SPCX1351*#*I am changing my flagship from Mississippi to Susquehanna. Will you help me pack my stuff and carry it to the other ship? I have a lot of stuff in the captain’s cabin.
SPCX1352*#*We are nearing the port in the Ryukyu Kingdom. This will be a rehearsal for what we will face in Edo. Let’s try this peacefully first and show them that they have much to gain by trading with us.
SPCX1353*#*We could use a coal supply station on one of these islands. I think I can convince the king to allow us to build the station here. I will try to resolve this with diplomacy.
SPCX1354*#*I will send some of our sailors to help the islanders build the coal station. We need to have a backup plan for getting coal here in case we won’t come to an agreement with the Japanese.
SPCX1355*#*We have made a further agreement with the king of the Ryukyu Islands. They are ready to start trading with the United States. Now we can get more supplies and sail for Edo.
SPCX1356*#*We will sail into Edo Bay and request a meeting with the representatives of the emperor. The Japanese have defenses there so we must present our superior power clearly.
SPCX1357*#*We are being surrounded by guard boats. Should they attack us, they will stand no chance against us, so we don’t have to worry. But make sure they can’t board our ships.
SPCX1358*#*There is a lone boat getting closer. I won’t speak with any low ranking officials. But we can show them the American hospitality. I heard the Japanese love fish and rice. There is still some rice left.
SPCX1359*#*The messenger said we should sail to Nagoya, where the Dutch ships are allowed to anchor. They just want to get rid of us. Let’s fire some shots from the cannons so they will take us more seriously.
SPCX136*#*We have almost everything ready. We have the time to get a nice hair cut. It would bring bad luck to do it after the New Year. I have already made a reservation for us.
SPCX1360*#*I will send a few men to visit the nearest fishing village and assess the situation in the country. A bit of money should make the locals more cooperative. I hope we will learn something useful.
SPCX1361*#*We need to give the letter from our president to the emperor. Only then can we be sure that it won’t get lost. I will send a few men in boats to survey the bay and remind the Japanese of our numbers.
SPCX1362*#*I have written a letter to the captain of the coastal guard. I requested to meet some high ranking officers again. Let’s eat something while we wait for an answer.
SPCX1363*#*At last, the Japanese agreed to arrange a meeting with the representative of the shogun, the military leader of the country. We need to anchor on the south bank. Prepare the boats for landing.
SPCX1364*#*I will need men to accompany me ashore. They will have to be armed, mostly for show but who knows what could happen. We will deliver president’s letter and leave.
SPCX1365*#*They don’t trust us, but I managed to convince them to let one of us stay here and prove our good intentions. Will you accept this important task, captain?
SPCX1366*#*We will be back for an answer to the president’s letter in a year. In the meantime, try to be diplomatic and help them with everything they ask. I will give you some more advice during dinner.
SPCX1367*#*I see you have learned the Japanese bow. Good. You can call me Shogun Tokugawa. First I would like some proof that our relationship will be profitable for us.
SPCX1368*#*You have access to money, that is a valuable characteristic for a business partner. But can you also obtain some more special materials?
SPCX1369*#*We don’t have much practice building large ships, because we have kept to ourselves. But we need to go beyond just our islands now. The knowledge of you and your sailors would be very welcome.
SPCX137*#*It’s time, my friend. Get out those fireworks and light them up. It will be a beautiful view for sure.
SPCX1370*#*That was an earthquake. They are common in Japan but this one was unusually strong. Help my men look through the wooden wreckage where the western wing of the palace used to be.
SPCX1371*#*The earthquake caused a lot of damage in the city. I have already sent my men to save as many people as they can. We will need to rebuild a lot of houses too.
SPCX1372*#*There is an incoming tsunami nearing the shore. Our coastal guards have spotted it in the distance. We need to build barriers to block the water. Bring whatever we can use.
SPCX1373*#*The water returned back to the sea. It left only wreckage and dying fish behind. Collect them from the ground, we can give them to the people who lost their homes and have nothing to eat.
SPCX1374*#*We are doing our best to get ready for these disasters, but sometimes it’s just not enough. There is a lot of work to be done before we fix what the tsunami did. I could use a good sake right now.
SPCX1375*#*Have you sent your men to help with the reconstruction? Then what are you waiting for? Many people have lost their homes and have nowhere to go. They need help as soon as possible.
SPCX1376*#*Japanese prefer wooden houses with walls of paper and floors of straw. These are the materials we will need. You might think they are easily destroyed, but it takes a strong earthquake to bring them down.
SPCX1377*#*I admit, your assistance after the disasters was invaluable. I will give the letter from president Fillmore a thought. I did not want to accept his request, but we might actually profit from it.
SPCX1378*#*You want to help us but how much are you really willing to trade? How about the secrets of making the ship cannons? The shots from your ships were impressive.
SPCX1379*#*You have really perfected the art of making firearms but even if poorly equipped, our samurais are excellent warriors. Unfortunately, their training dojo was destroyed during the earthquake too.
SPCX138*#*I love the traditional food! There are many specialties that we used to eat on the New Year but you can never go wrong with fish.
SPCX1380*#*Let’s take a small break from the serious business. I will teach you how to make a traditional Japanese dish. For sushi we will need some fresh fish, a tuna would be perfect.
SPCX1381*#*The sushi is ready. Now we need only a good warm sake. You can call your men too. We have enough food for them as well.
SPCX1382*#*Our coastal guards have spotted the black ships in Edo Bay again. Your friend Commodore Perry is here sooner than expected. Go greet him with your sailors and relay a message from me.
SPCX1383*#*After a discussion with my advisors I am inclined to agree to president Fillmore’s terms. However, we must discuss the details first. For this purpose a new meeting hall will be built in the port.
SPCX1384*#*These negotiations might take some time. That’s why it’s important that the meeting hall is furnished with everything necessary to make our guests comfortable.
SPCX1385*#*The sakoku, our foreign trade policy, was established because we were concerned about the influence of western culture and religion on our people. We must address these problems during the negotiations.
SPCX1386*#*My cooks will prepare some traditional Japanese food and serve it during the negotiations. I noticed you are a good fisherman, help them with the ingredients.
SPCX1387*#*We will display a few samurai armors in the main hall. Have you already seen one up close? It’s an impressive work. You can try it on if you would like.
SPCX1388*#*You can send your men for Commodore Perry and his companions. They are still aboard their ships. I am sure they will be glad to come ashore again.
SPCX1389*#*Now that everyone is here we can begin. But first, let’s welcome our guests with a glass of warm sake. Then we can introduce ourselves one by one and start the negotiations.
SPCX139*#*Today is the “Red mouth day”. We will be burning some paper over the trash cans. Don’t look so funny at me and bring me some paper.
SPCX1390*#*The talks are proceeding well. Perry asked me to allow him and his closest companions to stay in the town during the negotiations. We will build living quarters for them next to the hall.
SPCX1391*#*We have agreed that the Americans will pay us up front for the first purchase of coal and goods. It will make it easier for us to trust you. It’s necessary after the intimidation tactics you have used.
SPCX1392*#*Two ports, Hakodate and Shimoda, have been chosen to be open for the American ships. We will have to expand the docks there to accommodate the American fleet but the location of the ports is ideal.
SPCX1393*#*We are nearing the end of the talks. The agreement is already drafted, just a few more details need to be discussed. Let’s celebrate the successful negotiations with a festive dinner tonight.
SPCX1394*#*There will be an American consulate built in Shimoda. I have allowed the necessary security measures but it makes me a bit nervous to have armed foreigners in my country.
SPCX1395*#*You and your men know your way around Japan a bit by now. Show Perry and his sailors where the opened ports are and the site of the American consulate too.
SPCX1396*#*The Convention of Kanagawa has been signed. This means a new age for Japan. Now let’s toast to a mutually beneficial relationship between our countries.
SPCX1397*#*You have managed to convince the shogun to trust us and open his country to trade with us. Now we need to stock up on coal and then let’s go look at the opened ports and the site of the consulate.
SPCX1398*#*The most important thing we will bring back home is the Convention but we should buy some Japanese goods too. Don’t forget the traditional products like green tea, noodles and sake.
SPCX1399*#*The Japanese have chosen a nice location for our consulate. We can hire some workers and get the materials so the work on the building can start as soon as possible.
SPCX140*#*We should make some precautions next time so we don’t burn down the shack again. Let’s rebuild it with something that does not burn so easily.
SPCX1400*#*Did you see the samurai armor in the meeting hall? It was amazing but I loved the samurai sword the most. I must have a few of them at home too. I can’t imagine a better souvenir.
SPCX1401*#*Shimoda, the site of our consulate, is a small fishing port near Edo. There is not much going on here but it’s near the capital so the location is convenient. Let’s eat something and go check the second port.
SPCX1402*#*Hakodate is located on the northern island Hokkaido. It’s a larger town than Shimoda and here we can get ironware and some local products.
SPCX1403*#*Our sailors have run off to the town to taste the local sake and chase Japanese women. I admit, the girls are charming but we don’t need any scandals right now. Get them back to the ships.
SPCX1404*#*Everything is as we have agreed with the Shogun. I think we are ready to depart. Let’s check if our ships are ready for the long voyage home. There might be some minor repairs needed.
SPCX1405*#*One last thing before we set off home. We should get more katanas. I know a few weapon collectors who will love them. It will be also a nice gift for some of my friends.
SPCX1406*#*That is all, captain. Our mission has been successfully completed. We can go home now. Don’t forget to buy some souvenirs for yourself too.
SPCX1407*#*I am Princess Kazu, but you can call me Chikako. I heard the Shogun sent you with some gifts for me. I am especially curious what is inside that carved wooden chest.
SPCX1408*#*I don’t know how much you have been told, but I am Emperor’s younger sister. The Shogun hopes I will marry him and so lessen the tension between him and the Emperor.
SPCX1409*#*So the Shogun sent you to help seal this marriage. But it won’t be easy. I have grown up here in Kyoto, and I don’t want to move to Edo to the house of our enemies. Even the rice is better here.
SPCX141*#*Now that everything is presentable again we can call our friends and family for dinner. I hope you can cook better than burn paper.
SPCX1410*#*The Emperor does not like the new friendship between the Shogun and the foreigners. Are you here to prove how resourceful you are? We need help with the construction of the new temple.
SPCX1411*#*Inside the temple will be a large Buddha statue made from iron and covered in gold. I know you are probably no sculptor, but bring the materials and our artisans will take care of the rest.
SPCX1412*#*I am hungry. Do you have a good cook on your ship? I would like to try some food from your country. But nothing too exotic, I have a delicate stomach.
SPCX1413*#*You have forgotten the gold for the statue, right? Don’t worry, there is still time. Our sculptors have just finished the main structure and now they are ready to work on the gold coating.
SPCX1414*#*The statue is finished and can be moved inside the temple. If it were just a bit larger we would have to build the temple around it. We will still need a lot of men to transport it.
SPCX1415*#*There will be a wooden torii at the entrance to the temple. It is a gate that signifies the entrance into a holy place. You must have already seen some of them in Japan.
SPCX1416*#*I hope you learned a bit about our culture by now. The Emperor still does not trust you, but I think we can work together. Come, let’s eat dinner together.
SPCX1417*#*I feel like taking a walk. Come, I will show you Kyoto. The Imperial capital is full of beautiful temples and shrines. Some houses may need a bit of repairs, but it is still a wonderful city.
SPCX1418*#*The Shogun is the most powerful man in Japan. It has been so for long now. But our current Emperor plans to change it. I will tell you more while we eat.
SPCX1419*#*I will introduce you to the Imperial blacksmith. He is a good friend of our family. He can forge you a Japanese blade made just for you. It won’t be a cheap katana like you can find in any shop.
SPCX142*#*Everyone likes money, so we will make our guests a generous gift. After you get the coins put them into these red envelopes.
SPCX1420*#*You seem to be a good person. But I am not sure all foreigners are like you. Can we really trust you and open our country to the world? I would like to meet your crew too. Call them for dinner tonight.
SPCX1421*#*If I have to marry the Shogun and move to Edo, I need to have the same comfort there as at home, in Kyoto. Can you make sure I will have there everything I need?
SPCX1422*#*Have you seen some of my works already? I like to paint pictures on wooden blocks. It’s a traditional Japanese art. I think I am pretty good at it. I will make one for you, a picture of our holy mountain Fuji.
SPCX1423*#*I am ready to meet my future husband. Then I will make the decision if I will really marry him. We will need some food and drink for the official meeting.
SPCX1424*#*It’s good that you brought sake. The men will surely enjoy it, but I don’t drink alcohol. I will be drinking tea, which we still have plenty of. Now we need only food for our guests.
SPCX1425*#*We must appear perfect before the Shogun’s entourage and our palace too. The damaged pavement in the courtyard must be repaired as soon as possible!
SPCX1426*#*Shogun and his people have arrived. Go greet them with your men and lead them to the dining hall. I must go prepare myself. Putting on the kimono will take some time.
SPCX1427*#*I was afraid I would dislike him, but the Shogun seems kind and wise. He and the Emperor talked about politics a lot. About the need to arm ourselves once we leave the isolation.
SPCX1428*#*We can start preparing the wedding. My brother and the Shogun want to seal this alliance soon. I don’t trust the Shogun yet, but he conceded to all my conditions. Let’s go buy the wedding dress.
SPCX1429*#*I will need a new carriage to travel to Edo, where the wedding will take place. I will have to stay and live there afterward, so I must take all my things with me now.
SPCX143*#*Well, you certainly don’t know how to build houses, do you? We were lucky the shack did not bury our guests. Let’s rebuilt it again and this time properly!
SPCX1430*#*Let’s take some of the sake from Kyoto to the wedding. My brother says it’s the best sake in all of Japan and he is the Emperor, so when he thinks that, it must be true.
SPCX1431*#*I ordered a small shrine built in front of my old chambers in the Imperial Palace. That shall be a reminder that I used to live there. You can help the stone masons finish it.
SPCX1432*#*You and your sailors can come with me to Edo. I will need some protection and a friend too. Our samurais have to stay here and protect the Emperor.
SPCX1433*#*I am ready to get on the road. Pack some bento boxes so we won’t get hungry on the way. The cook is busy with the meal for the Emperor.
SPCX1434*#*I heard from the Shogun about the black ships you came on. They were made of metal and there was a lot of black smoke coming from them. Were they really burning?
SPCX1435*#*I don’t know much about ships, but I am sure the Shogun will want to learn all about the western shipbuilding. He will pay you well if you help him make such a strong ship for Japan.
SPCX1436*#*The big day is getting closer and I am getting a bit nervous. You will come too, right? I know it’s customary to bring a gift to the wedding, but something small will be enough.
SPCX1437*#*How do you like the wedding? My husband would like to talk to you about the ships. Go to him and take some of the sake from Kyoto. He still didn’t have the chance to taste it.
SPCX1438*#*Don’t leave your sailors waiting outside. They can come to the wedding too. But make sure they are dressed nicely. I have ordered my servants to prepare some clean clothes for them.
SPCX1439*#*I did not think there would be so many guests. They have already eaten all the food that was prepared for the feast. We will need to get more food fast.
SPCX144*#*I am stuffed from all the feasting so let’s make some food offerings for the Jade Emperor instead. He is the ruler of heaven and it is his birthday soon.
SPCX1440*#*The wedding was wonderful. Now I can go and see where I will live. My husband has ordered a new set of chambers to be built for me. But they are still not finished.
SPCX1441*#*My husband wants to talk to you about helping us build a steamship. I think he would prefer a wooden ship because that’s what we are familiar with.
SPCX1442*#*The steam engine will have to be made from iron, right? I want to learn as much as I can to be useful to the Shogun. I know he likes the pictures I paint but a wife should know more than that.
SPCX1443*#*It shall be a warship and will be fitted out with 30 cannons. We are not very good at building those. We will need to buy them from the Dutch, they will surely sell us a few.
SPCX1444*#*I guess serving on a big steamer is no easy job. Your crew must have a lot of experience with it. Will you train our sailors how to sail this ship?
SPCX1445*#*The first Japanese steamer is ready to be launched. You and your sailors helped us greatly. Let me invite you all for dinner, my husband would like to thank you personally.
SPCX1446*#*Thank you, captain. I am sure our country will benefit from making allies of people like you. This time I will make an exception and drink a glass of sake with you.
SPCX1447*#*Interested in cooperating on a big, revolutionary project? I could use a reliable partner. Show me the quality and speed of your ships by transporting some large cargo.
SPCX1448*#*I see you are a master of an impressive fleet and your skills in commanding it are not bad either. If you are interested, we can get down to business. An investment for the start will be necessary.
SPCX1449*#*I would also like to meet your crew. Good sailors are an important part of the sailing business. Don’t worry, I will just ask them a few questions, it will be no interrogation.
SPCX145*#*Do you have some money left? We could use some fireworks again. This special occasion calls for more burning beauty.
SPCX1450*#*Now let me explain what you are getting into. I have finished a steam railway across Britain not long ago. My dream is to extend the trading route across the Atlantic with a steamship service.
SPCX1451*#*I plan to build a large steamship that would be able to cross the Atlantic only with the power of steam. This has never been done before. Come, I will tell you more while we eat some fish and chips.
SPCX1452*#*The ship will be built mainly from wood. This will be the longest ship ever built, so we will need a lot of material. But don’t worry, we will start small with the outer structure.
SPCX1453*#*My railway is called Great Western and this will also be the name for this steamship. Let’s have a drink on the good start of the works.
SPCX1454*#*I am a civil engineer and a mechanic. I have worked on tunnels and bridges before, but this is my first ship. Your experience will be invaluable on this project, captain.
SPCX1455*#*Your sailors can help with the building process too. Their insight can improve the work of the men who will sail this ship. It should be possible to operate it with just a small crew.
SPCX1456*#*However, sailors are no shipbuilders. We will need to hire some professionals for this. We need capable men for the hard work and I will oversee the building of the ship.
SPCX1457*#*The hull of the ship is of wood but we will build iron reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. This ship will be enormous and so must be constructed accordingly.
SPCX1458*#*The reinforcements are done, but we will need more wood for the hull. We have barely finished half of it. I hope you are not tired yet. There is still a lot of work to be done.
SPCX1459*#*Let’s take a break today. I don’t want to impose but I would like to eat some dinner on your ship. My wife is with her family and I am not a good cook. I will bring some fine wine and cigars instead.
SPCX146*#*The fireworks were magnificent. Unfortunately it seems they have scared the pandas in the reservation. A generous donation of bamboo should remedy this.
SPCX1460*#*We have drunk almost all of the wine I had at home. My wife will be furious when she finds out. She doesn’t like me drinking too much. I should find some wine to replace what we have consumed.
SPCX1461*#*Back to work. We need to build four masts. The ship will be propelled by steam but in the case of need, she will have sails too. Call your sailors to help raise the pylons.
SPCX1462*#*While the sailors have been transporting the beams for the masts they destroyed the statue on the square. We need to fix this. I don’t want the police to find out.
SPCX1463*#*Everyone is afraid that there won’t be enough free space for the goods when we take fuel for the whole voyage across the ocean. I will prove them wrong. But first we will need to buy a lot of coal.
SPCX1464*#*The ship is looking good. Now to the essential part - the steam engine. The design is ready, let’s just get the materials and let the mechanics do their job.
SPCX1465*#*A fire has broken out by the steam engine! Quickly get some barrels with water before the fire spreads out. We can’t let our work go to waste.
SPCX1466*#*The ship is saved. But I have suffered some burns while trying to put out the fire. I won’t be able to attend the maiden voyage. Will you take my place on the ship?
SPCX1467*#*You will sail from Bristol to New York. Take your sailors with you. I don’t know who could manage it better than your crew. Show them what a great ship we have built!
SPCX1468*#*You have missed the chance to be the first to cross the Atlantic by steam power alone by a few days. Still, I think this project was a success. This deserves a toast!
SPCX1469*#*Great Western is ready for her first commercial voyage. I have received a request for a shipment of marble to New York. We have no marble here, but you can surely get some.
SPCX147*#*The workers of the reservation have asked us for some fish for the pandas too. But I don’t think they eat fish. It seems a bit strange to me but who are we to disagree.
SPCX1470*#*I already have a new project in mind. I like working with you and I promise this business will be worth it, just like before. So join me, my friend. Just a small investment and we can start.
SPCX1471*#*We are going to build a sister ship for our Great Western. She is so wonderful that we need more of her kind. But this time we will build a steamship completely out of iron.
SPCX1472*#*Of course, we will need some wood. I still want masts for sails on the ship in case we run out of fuel. As for the name, I am thinking Great Britain might suit her.
SPCX1473*#*This ship will be even larger than our first steamship. It would take years to build it with the workers we have. We will need some help of your sailors too.
SPCX1474*#*The work is coming along nicely. Your sailors have turned out to be pretty good shipbuilders too. I think they deserve some good food today.
SPCX1475*#*We can even let them have a bit of wine today. They can take a day off tomorrow. But after that, it’s hard work until the ship is finished.
SPCX1476*#*The building of this ship is much more expensive than I expected. But I am sure in the end it will be worth it and we will earn much more than we have invested.
SPCX1477*#*I am researching a new type of propulsion for the ship. A propeller is more efficient than a paddle wheel. There are only a few ships using it now, but I think this is the propulsion of the future.
SPCX1478*#*My wife wants to have children and the house where we live now is quite small. I want to build a Manor in the countryside for us. Will you help me with this personal project too?
SPCX1479*#*The manor should be surrounded by a large park full of trees. My wife loves the green of the leaves. Can you get some oaks and maples?
SPCX148*#*The pandas are really wonderful animals, don’t you think? I have decided to get myself one as a pet. It won’t be cheap but I am sure you can cover the expenses.
SPCX1480*#*I am sorry to keep you away from the steamship project. I am just going to test the steam engine. We will have men with buckets of water at the ready. No surprise fire this time.
SPCX1481*#*No fire broke out. But the buckets of water gave me an idea. We can make a large aquarium on the ship. It would be a nice decoration. I have already a large glass tank, now we need the fish.
SPCX1482*#*I have named the ship Great Britain. We only need to buy some equipment and she will be ready for her maiden voyage. This time I am going along too.
SPCX1483*#*We can set off on the maiden voyage. This will be the first iron hulled propeller-driven ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean. We are going down in history. This deserves a drink, I think.
SPCX1484*#*We are going too slow and the weather seems to be against us. The crashing waves have already broken off two of the propeller blades. I will have to fix this once we get to New York.
SPCX1485*#*A mast has broken away too. This storm is something I did not predict. But the Great Britain will endure, I am sure. Let’s hope we will get to New York soon without any more damage.
SPCX1486*#*The dockmaster promised to send us some guys to help with the repairs. He just wants some of the marble we delivered previously in return. The price for it is going up in the US.
SPCX1487*#*The repairs are finished and we are ready to return back to England. Let’s take more sailors aboard. Hopefully, we can avoid any more accidents on the way back.
SPCX1488*#*Another successful project is finished. Take some rest, captain. I am sure I will need your help soon again. Don’t forget to thank your sailors for the good work. Treat them to dinner in my name.
SPCX1489*#*I promised you another job, well, here it is. I have started to work on a design of a steamship that could sail to Australia and back without refueling. It will have to be enormous.
SPCX149*#*I have a loyal furry companion! Let’s celebrate this enlargement of my family by indulging in something sweet.
SPCX1490*#*I am still not completely sure if it would be possible to build such a titan. I must go talk it over with my friend who is a naval architect. You can come too, just bring a bottle of wine.
SPCX1491*#*Once again, the main material will be iron. But this Great Babe will be more than twice the size of our last ship Great Britain. I hope your fleet can deliver all we will need.
SPCX1492*#*The ship will have four decks and six masts. Sails will be only an auxiliary power source. The main power will come from five steam engines.
SPCX1493*#*She will be able to carry the fuel needed for a voyage from London to Sydney and back and still carry 4000 passengers. We will have to substitute the passengers with some cargo first, to test it.
SPCX1494*#*Such a large ship will need not only a propeller but four paddle wheels as well. They are already constructed we just need to get the men to install them on the hull.
SPCX1495*#*The cost of the five steam engines is higher than we have expected. But we need them all to power this large ship. We will have to get the money from somewhere.
SPCX1496*#*I have thought about the name for the Great Babe. How about Leviathan? Now to more pressing matters. I heard there are problems with the food rations for the workers. Can you do something about it?
SPCX1497*#*All five engines need a funnel so we will have five of them too. It's time to start working on them. We will need a delivery of that quality iron you have shipped to us before.
SPCX1498*#*The main structure is already done. We can concentrate on the furnishing of the inner areas. I have designed her as a luxurious ship, but there will be quarters for the less wealthy too.
SPCX1499*#*The ship is ready to be christened. We will need a bottle of wine to break against the hull. Bring more of the bottles, I am sure we will have a use for them. I am still not sure which name to choose.
SPCX150*#*We should not forget about the dragons. Don’t worry, they are not real dragons. We will need some cloth, paper and bamboo to create them.
SPCX1500*#*I have planned the launching a week from now. The tide should be high and it will help us get the ship into the water. But we will still need some equipment to haul her into the water.
SPCX1501*#*It took three attempts to get the ship into the water. But she is afloat at last. Now we can plan the maiden voyage. Are your sailors willing to help us with that again?
SPCX1502*#*The first voyage won’t be long but some food will be needed. Apart from that, we are ready to go. We have enough coal to start this maiden voyage.
SPCX1503*#*We have hardly left the docks and one engine exploded. It blew off the first funnel and killed two men. We will have to pay something to their families. This should not have happened.
SPCX1504*#*It was not a design mistake, just the steam exhaust remained closed and this caused overheating of the engine. We will have to fix the engine and funnel before the ship can sail again.
SPCX1505*#*There is still some damage to the main deck and the inner areas around the engine. This should not take long to fix. We have already scheduled the first commercial voyage.
SPCX1506*#*Great Eastern is on its way to Portland. There is not enough trade with Australia to use it on the Eastern run. Nevertheless, our work here is done. Time to sit down and have a drink.
SPCX1507*#*Hey! Ye must be lost, matey! This’s not a port for ordinary sailors. Nassau is the Republic of Pirates. Why are ye here? Do ye have somethin’ to sell?
SPCX1508*#*Ye look like a decent fellow. Such as you are mugged and trashed here. But I will show you the way around and even offer ye some protection. For a modest fee, of course.
SPCX1509*#*Ye have doubts if a woman can protect ye? Don’t ye worry, dearie, I am probably the best shot ye will meet here. Give me a gun and I will shoot any target ye give me.
SPCX151*#*The two of us will not be enough to make the dragons and perform the dance. Get some help because these will not be some little monsters.
SPCX1510*#*So ye came here to trade. Ye can’t go wrong with offering some food. All men and women must eat, pirates too. Ye would do best to offer what ye have to the innkeeper. He needs a lot of supplies.
SPCX1511*#*Ye could make business here with selling fish. But ye know what every pirate loves most? A strong booze. They don’t care much about the quality, so ye can sell them almost anything.
SPCX1512*#*We became such good friends, that I will even give yer guys some tips on how to avoid pirates. Get them here and we can talk. Keep some of the bottles here so I can wet me tongue.
SPCX1513*#*Life of a pirate is tough. Many lose a leg or a hand, at worst their own life. For the last thing there is no medicine, but if ye have some wooden legs to sell, ye will find here buyers for sure.
SPCX1514*#*I don’t have me own ship. I sail with me husband James. He never lets me captain the ship. How about we go on an adventure together? It would take just a small investment from ye.
SPCX1515*#*Leave yer cargo here, we will need a lot of space. No worries, me men will guard it with their lives. And now I will show ye what it means to be a pirate.
SPCX1516*#*I know ye specialize in trade and peaceful negotiations. But if ye want to deal with pirates ye have to be dangerous yerself. So get some weapons!
SPCX1517*#*Booze is for the time after the successful raid. Ye don’t need yer men drunk during the fight. Just bring it to Nassau and I will find ye a good buyer for it.
SPCX1518*#*Now we get to the open sea and look out for a lone ship. While we search, ye can fish or somethin’. We might be here for a while.
SPCX1519*#*A fine merchant galley is on the horizon. Pack the fish ye caught in some crates and let’s go after them. We mustn't let them escape!
SPCX152*#*I hope you remember my panda friend. I have decided to call him Ping. He seems very happy with me, but he still doesn't have a proper home. We need to build him one.
SPCX1520*#*We are not going to slit their throats, let’s just scare them with a few gunshots and then have a nice talk. I will leave the talking to ye. And keep yer crew silent or it might all end in a blood bath.
SPCX1521*#*Our first earnings, captain! That was not bad at all. Ye were very convincing. I miss a good fight but at least no one of the crew is wounded or dead. Now let’s tie the guys up and take their gold.
SPCX1522*#*We can't just leave the crew of the ship free. They might try something. We don’t have enough rope to tie all of them. Look if there are some chains below deck. We can use that instead.
SPCX1523*#*These guys were transporting a quality wine from France. This will get us a nice sum at Nassau. But we wouldn’t be pirates if we just sell it so easily. Let’s fill up the bottles with some cheap stuff.
SPCX1524*#*There was also a chest with precious stones in the captain’s cabin. I would like to keep those and make some earrings out of them. Take them to the goldsmith in Kingston. He is a master of his trade.
SPCX1525*#*As a rule, I always try to sell the loot first. Only then can we celebrate. Let’s pack it into crates and visit a trustworthy merchant. I know just the one who will be interested in our goods.
SPCX1526*#*Now that we are back in Nassau, it’s time to celebrate our success. I will take ye to me favorite inn. They have cheap and good ale. But if ye want to eat too, it’s better to bring yer own food.
SPCX1527*#*I will tell ye one thing but keep it to yourself. Me husband is a rat. He is informing the governor. I don’t like this at all. I like the pirate life. Ye paying the next round? I am all out of money.
SPCX1528*#*There is this one guy, Jack Rackham. He is a real pirate, not like me husband, that good for nothin’. James doesn’t care for me anyway. Call yer guys for a drink too, I am feelin’ lonely.
SPCX1529*#*We have no more money to buy drinks for yer guys. But if ye still have some cheap stuff locked up on yer ship, now is the time to get it.
SPCX153*#*It is said that chocolate gives you a lot of energy. And we will surely need it to make these dragons seem alive and dancing.
SPCX1530*#*Time to get back to work. I will try to find out if any ships with treasure are nearby. But we will have to be quick, there is a lot of competition here. Ye prepare the ship and everythin’ necessary.
SPCX1531*#*One acquaintance knows about a rich prize. I will have to pay for the information with precious stones we got from the last raid. But they assured me the treasure in this ship will be worth it.
SPCX1532*#*I know everything we will need to catch this ship. Let’s get on board! Make sure ye have enough loose planks to bridge the gap between the ships. Last time we had to jump across.
SPCX1533*#*Do ye see the sails in the distance? That must be the treasure ship! Let’s get closer under the disguise of being a humble fishing vessel. Then we will take out the cannons.
SPCX1534*#*The ship is full of armed soldiers. We have no chance against them. Let’s get the ship out of here and fast! Who is not busy with the ship should shoot at the soldiers.
SPCX1535*#*I have a hunch that me husband had a hand in this. Who knows if it was just bad luck or if he wanted to get rid of me. I am going to ask around, I know how to loosen the tongue of men.
SPCX1536*#*I have had enough of me treacherous husband. I am leaving with Jack. I don’t think James will look for me, but I better disappear for a time. It was good working with ye, captain.
SPCX1537*#*Welcome to me Inn, sailor. What can I bring you? Ale and some warm soup perhaps? We have a freshly baked loaf of bread too. I will be back with it in a minute.
SPCX1538*#*Ye interested in some gossip while ye eat? I own this inn, the leaking roof and the creaking doors included. Since me husband died it’s become hard taking care of it. I could use some help fixing it.
SPCX1539*#*I ain’t no proper innkeeper. I used to be a sailor like you. This was all me husband’s idea. To settle down, start a family. What good is it since he ain’t here anymore?
SPCX154*#*The cost of the festivities was large, but there is a charm that can help us gain more money in the new year. Fish brings luck and a surplus of money so let’s dig in!
SPCX1540*#*I long to return to the sea. Feel the wet breeze in me hair and the salty water on me face. I would enjoy some fresh fish for a meal. No proper fisher in this town, I tell ye.
SPCX1541*#*If ye help me, I will return to me old life. But sailing is a man’s world. I would have to pretend to be one of them. Still, a girl among men needs a way of protecting herself.
SPCX1542*#*I looked for a captain in the port who would take me aboard. But no one needs a new sailor. Isn’t there a free place on your ship, cap’n? I know I would get along with yer sailors.
SPCX1543*#*I am so glad, to be on deck again! Thank ye for giving me this chance, ye will not regret it. Ye have a fine ship here, cap’n. But I think she could use a new chain for the anchor. This one’s pretty rusty.
SPCX1544*#*Ye are a merchant right? I served on a merchant ship before, I know me way around. I can help stow the cargo, I have done this many times. Just show me the crates and I will get to work.
SPCX1545*#*What goods are we going to buy next? I know about a sugar merchant with the best prices in the Caribbean. If ye are interested, I will give ye the coordinates.
SPCX1546*#*I have bad news, cap’n. Ship with black sails is closing on us from the south. We should get rid of all unnecessary cargo and try to flee as fast as we can. We are not ready for a fight.
SPCX1547*#*Seems we can’t run from them after all. Fill the first few crates with fish, they might dismiss the rest of the cargo like not having anything valuable. And stay calm.
SPCX1548*#*They must not get to ye, I will pretend to be the captain and speak with them in yer stead. Don’t worry, I have some experience with this lot. Give yer men weapons in case a fight is unavoidable.
SPCX1549*#*Drop the anchor and prepare for boarding. Let’s try to avoid any casualties and to give up peacefully. Let’s hope they will fall for the ruse with the fish barrels.
SPCX155*#*After so many shipments your ships must be in need of a proper maintenance. Get some materials to make them seaworthy again.
SPCX1550*#*They found out about the ruse. Our false cargo did not fool them. We will have to give them what they want or fight. And I would advise against the second option. I am sorry this plan failed.
SPCX1551*#*The pirate cap’n Rackham offered to take me aboard as one of his pirates. I didn’t tell ye I was workin’ as a pirate before. I will accept and speak to them about not hurting ye and yer crew.
SPCX1552*#*Anne is cap'n Rackham’s second in command. It’s surprising to see another woman so high among the pirates. She told me that she knows the captain of yer ship. Is she yer acquaintance?
SPCX1553*#*I did not take ye to be a friend of pirates. But it has not only saved yer life but also brought ye an offer of a good deal. The pirates need to trade some cargo they have acquired.
SPCX1554*#*Anne has put in a good word for ye. Ye can sail with us under the flag of cap'n Rackham. Get some weapons for yer men and let’s get this business started. The work of a pirate is nothing hard.
SPCX1555*#*I hope ye have no problems with a bit of pirate work. I know, it’s nothing to be proud about but a girl has to earn her living somehow. Let’s get some food for now and worry about it later.
SPCX1556*#*I promise I will look for a way how to get ye out of this. But now we have to go and catch us that galley before us. Do ye see how heavy she sits in the water? She must be fully loaded.
SPCX1557*#*The galley is named William, she was shipping stone to Havana. Not the best catch we could have made. But with your trading experience maybe ye can sell it for a good price.
SPCX1558*#*Don’t forget to share the price ye got for the stone. It’s never wise to try to slight the pirates, they will make you regret that to the last drop of yer blood.
SPCX1559*#*We are heading for Nassau. I heard ye were there before. So ye must know it’s better to nail down everything ye don’t want to lose. If pirates are good at somethin’, it’s stealin’.
SPCX156*#*It seems that Ping has outgrown his pen. Get us some material so we can build him a larger one. Who would have thought that pandas can get so big.
SPCX1560*#*The crew is going to have some fun at the brothel, but me and Anne want to go buy new equipment. The ship also needs some upgrading. Ye know yer way around ships, will ye take care of it?
SPCX1561*#*We also want to buy some better weapons for the crew. But here in Nassau, the offer is poor. There is a good weapon merchant in Kingston, will ye sail there and bring a few?
SPCX1562*#*The crew of cap'n Kidd has secured a shipment of rum. They have invited us to share it with them. I prefer to stay sober, but we can have some food at least.
SPCX1563*#*Enough work for today. Will ye play cards with me and Anne? I hope ye have something valuable to bet. A few precious stones will do.
SPCX1564*#*Ye are no good at cards, friend. Yer money are mine now. Don’t worry I will give ye a chance to win them back, but now ye have to pay what ye owe me.
SPCX1565*#*I have seen some strange light out on the water. No ship should be near the cove this late at night. I don’t like this. Better go rouse yer men, we may need to fight.
SPCX1566*#*And those lousy pirates are drunk to oblivion. Anne won’t leave here without Rackham and I can’t leave her face the soldiers alone. Ye go! We can take care of ourselves. Good luck, cap'n!
SPCX1567*#*Where are you sailing? Will you help a girl in need? My ship got into a storm and I alone survived. I have been here on this wreck for three days, starving and freezing.
SPCX1568*#*I had a pet bird, he was below deck when we took on water. Will you please go and look for him. I did not dare to go down there and look at all the drowned men. I called but nobody answered.
SPCX1569*#*Surprise, surprise! You better give up before we kill ya all. No sense in resisting us. Give us all the gold and we may spare your lives.
SPCX157*#*Ping loves his new home. However since he has grown so big he eats much more than I can afford. Can you lend me some money for feeding him? I know you adore him too.
SPCX1570*#*Calm down, captain! It was just a joke. We did not want to hurt you, of course. No need to let us walk the plank. I said I am sorry!
SPCX1571*#*I am sure we can find some profitable way to get all out of this alive. So what do you say if we help to get you some stuff you need. We will just make a small trade and everyone will be happy.
SPCX1572*#*Who could have guessed that you and your men are such good fighters. Ever considered a career of a pirate? If you would rather earn your living honestly, I will show you where you can make good deals.
SPCX1573*#*This is my husband, George. He got me into this business. He is an unsuccessful blacksmith. If you give him some iron, he can probably make you a decent sword or something.
SPCX1574*#*George is not a very good blacksmith. But don’t worry, we have many other talents, which we can use to apologize for our unpleasant welcome. For example, we can turn fish into gold.
SPCX1575*#*These fools here will buy even foul fish. But I must admit your fish looked quite fresh. You can get pretty much anything, right? How about some parrots? I always said that a proper pirate needs a parrot.
SPCX1576*#*Our crew has been operating in these waters for some time now. I know my way around. If you want I will tell you where you can trade and earn a fortune. Just send your men with the goods.
SPCX1577*#*I ran away from home with George and we married. It was hard to come by some gold. So we ended up in the pirate business. I still hope to get enough money to build a house and leave this career behind.
SPCX1578*#*It’s nice of you to help me after what happened. Makes me feel bad about how we wanted to trick you. If you still feel generous, you can get us more materials for the house.
SPCX1579*#*My husband got into a fight at the Inn and the guards took him in. He needs to pay for the damage but since we did not succeed at our last raid, we don’t have enough money.
SPCX158*#*This will be a year of the Fire Monkey. I heard it will be a bad year for people born in a year of Monkey. Good that I am a Dragon. What Chinese zodiac sign are you?
SPCX1580*#*Thank you for helping us. I will make some dinner for you tonight in our new house. You don’t need to bring anything, only if you want to eat something special.
SPCX1581*#*We need to get ready for the next raid. I promise we will not attack your ships anymore. I hope we will stumble upon some easy prey this time. But we should be armed properly anyway.
SPCX1582*#*A storm has surprised us on the sea. Our ship sunk, I only managed to get to shore clinging to a piece of wood. George and most of our men are lost. Please, help me look for them.
SPCX1583*#*Could you not find them? Maybe if you let the parrots loose over the bay, they will spot them. I know, that there is only a small hope of finding them alive, but we must do something.
SPCX1584*#*George and a few of our men were washed out on the beach early this morning. They were all dead. I knew it, but I just did not want to give up. There is no denying it now. Help me build them a grave.
SPCX1585*#*Now I will try to find honest work. I worked as a maid before, maybe I can do that again. Until I find a job I will have to live from scraps. I have hardly any money left.
SPCX1586*#*A wealthy family has employed me as their maid. I will miss the sea, but without George, I would not dare to return among the sailors. It’s not for every girl.
SPCX1587*#*Have we met already? Arrr, I’m not sure. I’m not good at remembering faces. Anyway, ye better give me somethin’ of value or ye will end up as food for sharks.
SPCX1588*#*Women are getting into pirate business. What’s this world coming to? During my times, this was strictly men’s world. Women stayed in the kitchen. I think I need a drink, Arrrr.
SPCX1589*#*An old pirate like me has a name to live up to. Ye won’t escape so easily this time. Only if ye manage to get me drunk and slip away. But I warn ye, I can hold me liquor.
SPCX159*#*The New Year’s festivities come to an end. We should enjoy the last moments by watching the warmly glowing lanterns rise up into the sky.
SPCX1590*#*Look who’s here? The fearless captain who wants to sail through the pirate territory. If ye want to escape with all yer limbs intact, ye will have to fight yer way out. Get him, lads!
SPCX1591*#*Still getting into me way, matey? I think ye have a death wish. Ye are lucky me pistol fell into the water. It’s useless trash now. Bring me new ones and I might not slit yer throat.
SPCX1592*#*Do ye even know what to do with all those pistols? They belong into the hands of a feared pirate. Not a merchant like ye. Give them here before ye shoot yerself.
SPCX1593*#*What are ye doin’ here anyway? Don’t ye know these waters are full of pirates? Well, at least ye have armed yerself properly. But ye could flee faster if ye leave the pistols here.
SPCX1594*#*They make a racket like a hundred drunken sailors. This time I will spare yer lives if ye get rid of those noisy parrots. Or ye know what, leave them here. Arrr, I bet they will taste like chicken.
SPCX1595*#*I never had a pet parrot during me whole pirate career. Seemed kinda foolish to me. But maybe such talking bird could be a fine companion. But I need a special parrot, evil like me.
SPCX1596*#*I am tired of meeting ye all over the place and still ye manage to escape unscathed. Yet the rest of me fleet is lost somewhere. Maybe we could use those birds of yers as messengers.
SPCX1597*#*Not a step closer, matey! This treasure chest is mine. But no matter what I do, I can't open it. Listen! Get me the key and I will share the treasure with ye. Try looking here: @Fan Page@https://www.facebook.com/Seaportgame/@
SPCX1598*#*I thought I would freeze to death. It’s so good to see you, my friend. Let’s get to the kitchen, throw some wood into the stove and I will tell you everything.
SPCX1599*#*What are you doing here, near the North Pole? It’s good I spotted your ship, captain, or else I would have frozen to death. Can you spare some food? I have not eaten in days.
SPCX160*#*Thank you for all your help. I hope you have enjoyed the Chinese New Year as much as I did. Here are some sweet dumplings, remember our fun while you eat them.
SPCX1600*#*We should anchor here in the bay and wait until the snow storm blows over. Meanwhile, I can tell you how I got here. It’s a long story so you better get ready.
SPCX1601*#*It all began when I was admitted to the University of Ingolstadt. Even though it was hard for my family to pay for, I was very happy. At least until I learned about my mother’s death.
SPCX1602*#*This tragedy made me spend all my free time and money to pursue the secrets of life. I did even sew my own clothes from old rags so I could spend all my finances on laboratory equipment.
SPCX1603*#*I made my secret laboratory in an abandoned cellar room. I had to remove all sorts of rubbish from there and clean it up properly before it was ready to become my workroom.
SPCX1604*#*Never again do I want to mourn the death of a loved one. Come, my friend, join me on my quest to conquer death! But first send your men away. We don't need too many witnesses to our work.
SPCX1605*#*The things we will do here might shock and disgust the regular people. So we must hide behind closed doors. No one must see what we attempt here before we can present them with the results of our work.
SPCX1606*#*And so here I am, a fool hoping to make the impossible into reality. I will need all sorts of things to achieve this end. Buy what you can and steal the rest. We are doing this for the greater good.
SPCX1607*#*There is still some equipment missing. I will need some tongs and knives, even a hammer and a saw. Don’t ask! Just bring me what I need!
SPCX1608*#*I would give up all food and sleep just so I could spend all my time on work. But alas! I can’t live without something to eat. Please, take care of it while I prepare the experiment.
SPCX1609*#*I need a large container, made of something hard and non-corrosive. It should be the size of human body and I will fill it with water. It won't be an aquarium, so it doesn't need to be made out of glass.
SPCX161*#*My name is Maewyn. But I am also known as Patrick. I come to help the people of Ireland for which I will need your assistance. Don’t worry, you will get a reward for it.
SPCX1610*#*This stone bathtub is perfect. Just what I need. I will go and get the most important part of my experiment. I have to select it with great care. You can get some thread and needles. We will need them too.
SPCX1611*#*Don’t look at it like that! It’s not a corpse, it’s my masterpiece. It will be living soon, you will see! Now board up the door. I heard some people snooping around. We won’t leave here until we are done.
SPCX1612*#*Life is energy and we need to get some of it into this unmoving body. We will need a few men to turn this crank and the dynamo will make electricity out of it. Yes, you can open the door.
SPCX1613*#*Once I finish my work, no one will have to stay dead. Everyone can have their loved ones back. I don’t want to make a profit out of it, but the process is quite expensive.
SPCX1614*#*We could not produce enough electricity to wake him up. I must think of a new way to do it. We will definitely need more iron rods to lead the power into the body.
SPCX1615*#*I don’t know how to proceed. Maybe we need a short break. I have a terrace in my apartment. How about we grill some fish there tonight? I hope I will get a new idea soon.
SPCX1616*#*Seems we have no luck these days. This storm has completely ruined our plans. Come I will bake the fish in the oven and then I will show you how to sew. I find it is a calming pastime.
SPCX1617*#*Did you see that lightning? It struck the building across the street. I just got an idea! We can use this as the power source. Let’s make a platform on the roof.
SPCX1618*#*Now we just have to transport the body. But if someone sees us, we could be in big trouble. We will need a large box, maybe a big coffin will do.
SPCX1619*#*I had no idea the creature was so heavy. We need to get some help, otherwise we will never get it on the roof in time. The storm might end soon. Find some men who won’t ask questions.
SPCX162*#*We will need to take a ship to get to our destination. I come from Britain but I know Ireland well. I have been there for 6 years as a shepherd on those green pastures.
SPCX1620*#*Pay our helpers generously and make sure they won’t talk about this. Then get on the roof. Fast! We have to build the resurrection machine before the storm dies out.
SPCX1621*#*We need a large lightning rod. It will be tricky to avoid getting hit by the lightning while we are installing it. But leave the details to me, just get us a large iron rod.
SPCX1622*#*Ok, now just to finish some last few stitches here and there. The body got a bit torn up while we were transporting it. Make sure we have a strong thread this time.
SPCX1623*#*It...it’s uglier than I thought it would be. Hey! Can you understand me? Hmm, looks like it can’t speak. We must get it into my apartment. Let’s try to lure it with some food.
SPCX1624*#*The fish did not interest it, but we managed to get it somehow inside the flat. I admit I am a bit afraid. It’s just so big. We must barricade the door. It cannot get out.
SPCX1625*#*Can you hear how it destroys everything in my apartment? Maybe it is angry we locked it up. I will have to repair everything. Let’s go to a bar or something. I cannot deal with it right now.
SPCX1626*#*We were away for quite a while... But do you hear that? It’s quiet in the apartment. Where is the creature? He must have jumped out of the window. Ask the people on the street if they have seen it.
SPCX1627*#*No luck finding the creature? I must say I am a bit relieved. I don’t know what I would have done with it. It was obviously a failed experiment. A wild thing without reason.
SPCX1628*#*I have seen you with my creator. Will he miss you if I kill you?
SPCX1629*#*I will be good. I can’t fight you anymore, you have destroyed my body. Some things are falling apart.
SPCX163*#*It wasn't an easily life. I have been kidnapped and had to work as a slave. But these hardships have made me tough as a stone so I can return now and help the Irish.
SPCX1630*#*You are the first human to help me. Everybody screams and runs from me. Why am I so different? I try to pretend to be like them, to eat, speak, and work. But nothing helps.
SPCX1631*#*No, I really don’t like food. I can’t taste anything. It just clogs up my throat. You keep it, humans have to eat. What I need is a hiding place. Somewhere dark. A cave or a cellar.
SPCX1632*#*My creator threw me into this life full of loneliness and hatred. What should I do now? I will at least punish the creator for making me the monster everyone fears. He will be as lonely as I am.
SPCX1633*#*You have led people to me! To kill me? To burn me? You treacherous human! I should have known never to trust one of you. What are they carrying? Planks and sticks to beat me with?
SPCX1634*#*Oh, you have only led them here to help build a hiding place for me? But they must not see me! Not everyone is as nice as you. As soon as they are done, pay them and send them away.
SPCX1635*#*I don’t have a name. I was just given my miserable life and this hideous body. Just call me monster, creature, or that thing like everybody else. I don’t care. I only need this body to work properly.
SPCX1636*#*This part does not fit me. We need to cut a piece off here and here. Don’t look so sick, it’s just dead meat. Like all of me. Just bring me a saw and I will do it myself.
SPCX1637*#*I want to know more about my creator. Tell me, does he have brothers, sisters? Someone he loves?
SPCX1638*#*Don’t try to shut me up with food! I will learn what I need to know and exact my revenge on him like he deserves.
SPCX1639*#*Now you try to barricade me inside my home? If you try to get in my way, I will kill you. Go warn them if you must, or send someone with a message, but you won’t be able to stop me.
SPCX164*#*I had a dream. A dream that I should return to Ireland and help its people. So we are going back. The first thing we need is a ship that will take us there.
SPCX1640*#*I have told you that it is useless to try to stop me. One of the creator’s brothers is dead. You can go to the police but who will believe you that an undead monster did it?
SPCX1641*#*Taking a finger that fell off as evidence was clever. But when it’s not attached to me, it’s just a thumb from a corpse. What you can do is get a coffin for the body of creator's brother.
SPCX1642*#*Don’t you understand? There is no reason for me to be alive other than revenge. You can’t take that away from me too. I can’t even go out among people, to the theater or to a shop.
SPCX1643*#*You have taken me to the theater, that was nice of you. You still hope to redeem me, don’t you? But I can’t always hide in the corner wrapped up in a large cloak. Just go, eat something and think about it.
SPCX1644*#*How can you still stay by my side? Are you not worried I will kill you too? I am a monster. You must be hiding some weapons, right? Pretending to use them only in self-defense.
SPCX1645*#*This room is caving in already. I should have known, you are no builder. I will have to leave. But where will I go? You can try to repair this, but I can’t stay here forever anyway.
SPCX1646*#*Now I know what I must do to escape this loneliness. No humans will ever love me. Take me to England on one of your ships. Don’t try to refuse me or I will kill more people here.
SPCX1647*#*I am going to speak with my creator. I will tell him my tale and request he makes a companion for me. Only then will I escape this loneliness. I will collect the materials he will need.
SPCX1648*#*After what he has done to me, he can’t refuse. We need to hide the materials for my bride in boxes. It looks suspicious transporting body parts.
SPCX1649*#*I stand out too much, I need some clothes which will cover me from head to toe. I don’t want to attract unwanted attention. Just buy the largest clothes you can find and bring them to me.
SPCX165*#*It seems we don’t need to build our own ship. I have already found one on which we can sail to Ireland. But it won’t be for free, we need to pay for the ferry.
SPCX1650*#*I am meeting the creator in the woods. Don’t worry I won’t kill him. I need his help in creating my companion. But if you don’t trust me, you can get some weapons. They can hurt me a bit.
SPCX1651*#*This is not a friendly meeting. But I see you and my creator share some history. Fine, prepare some food and share your stories. I don’t care. Just persuade him to create my bride.
SPCX1652*#*I think it was out of fear. I could see the fright in his eyes. But that is good, he should be afraid of what he has created. You go and find a good place where he can set up his laboratory.
SPCX1653*#*We need only the parts of the most beautiful women for my bride. The ones we took with us are already too rotten to be used. Make sure you choose the fresh ones this time.
SPCX1654*#*We will have to wait for a big storm. But first, let’s build the resurrection machine. To complete it as soon as possible we will need some help. I know you can get some trustworthy men.
SPCX1655*#*The creator is starting to get some second thoughts. He worries that she will be a monster like me. We can’t allow him to back off now. Pay him if you must, but make sure he continues his work.
SPCX1656*#*The storm is here. Everything is ready. In a minute I won’t be alone anymore. I can’t wait to meet her. She will be perfect, I know it. Prepare the lightning rod!
SPCX1657*#*Isn’t she beautiful? She must be scared. Be quiet! I will talk to her. You go prepare a room for her. She needs rest before we leave for the wilderness.
SPCX1658*#*Tell the monster to stay away. Where am I? What is happening? Take me away from here... I-I feel so empty. Maybe I am hungry. I don’t know anymore.
SPCX1659*#*I can’t taste the food. And I can’t remember anything either. Who am I? Can you tell me? And why are there dead bodies around? Shouldn’t they be buried properly in a grave?
SPCX166*#*The ship that will take us to Ireland has delivered marble to the port. However, they have not brought enough of it and they are in trouble now. Could we help them?
SPCX1660*#*The monster sneaked inside my room tonight and told me we are mates. That can’t be. I am not like him. Will you send some men to watch my room? I don’t want that creature near me again.
SPCX1661*#*No! That awful creature reflected on the water surface can’t be me! I cannot let other people see me like this. I need new clothes and makeup so I can get out of here. Please, help me.
SPCX1662*#*Please don’t leave me here. Doctor Frankenstein wants to give me to that horrible monster. We just need to create a distraction. Mess up the equipment in his lab so we can escape.
SPCX1663*#*Can you prepare a cabin for me on your ship? We must leave tonight. I can’t stay here a moment longer. I hope everything is ready.
SPCX1664*#*Thank you for bringing me into the city. I will try to find a place to stay. You must go back or they will suspect you helped me escape. I just need something to defend myself.
SPCX1665*#*You are back, captain. I did not think I would see you again. You are wondering how I got to live in such a mansion? I was lucky, it was abandoned. Come inside, I will prepare some food.
SPCX1666*#*Oh, you found the bodies. They were like that when I came. There must have been a burglar who broke in and killed them. Such a horrible accident. Let’s bury the poor souls in the yard.
SPCX1667*#*When you are already here, can you help me some more? I need some money to buy clothes. I am looking for a job and I need to look good. I will pay you back when I find work.
SPCX1668*#*It’s been really hard for me. I am not like the other people. It’s difficult to find friends. I am glad I have you at least. Even taking care of this huge house is tiring. There are cobwebs everywhere.
SPCX1669*#*I was at an audition for a role in the newest play in the theatre. I heard the lead actress had a terrible accident. It’s sad, but a new actress must be chosen.
SPCX167*#*Ireland is not too far from here. Nevertheless we will need some food for the journey. Let’s pack some provisions that will keep us happy and fed.
SPCX1670*#*This old house does not even have electricity. And I don’t have the money to buy a new one. I will have to try installing the electricity here instead. Unfortunately, I have no clue about such work.
SPCX1671*#*There is a lot of rats in this house. They gather here as if they smell some dead meat. I can’t stand these filthy animals. Help me place a few traps around the house.
SPCX1672*#*We need to place some food on the traps that will lure in the rats. Something with a strong smell will work best. And no, I won’t give my shoes for this.
SPCX1673*#*There was police at the door. They asked about the family that lived here. You must tell them we were together the night they disappeared. I was alone so there is no one to speak up for me.
SPCX1674*#*What? Now you don’t want to help me? Do you think I killed them? That is ridiculous! They were not nice people anyway. They told me I am an ugly monster.
SPCX1675*#*Did you send your men for the police? So that they come to arrest me? You will die for your betrayal!
SPCX1676*#*Did you think that the torches and rakes could kill me? You are too weak to use them against me. And I am too quick. You will have to pay a bounty hunter to get me.
SPCX1677*#*So you caught me at last. Fine, I give up. I was not meant to be alive anyway. Just grant me this last wish and make sure doctor Frankenstein works on something better next time.
SPCX1678*#*You helped the creature who murdered my brother! I know you believe the best of everyone but sometimes you are just naive. We must catch it and put it in chains.
SPCX1679*#*I know, I am at fault here. I should never have attempted to go against nature. What is dead should stay dead. Let’s just send the men across the land and hope we will find the monster.
SPCX168*#*I don’t need much but a journey like this will cost us something. I say better safe than sorry. Go and take some of your savings so we don’t have to beg.
SPCX1680*#*The men have returned with no news of the creature’s whereabouts. I must return home to my family, I am afraid he might do something horrible again. Can you buy me a train ticket?
SPCX1681*#*Thankfully, everyone is alright. But I must wonder what is the creature doing. Come, visit me tonight, we will go through our next plans. My fiancée will cook dinner.
SPCX1682*#*If no more accidents happen, we want to marry soon. Elizabeth can’t wait to walk down the aisle. She wants to wear her grandma’s dress. It’s beautiful, it just needs to be mended a bit.
SPCX1683*#*She knows nothing about my work, so please don’t tell her. We need to secure the house. I would die if something happened to her. I will tell her there is a criminal on the loose.
SPCX1684*#*I am afraid the monster would tear the wooden fence apart like paper. We need something stronger to secure the house. It’s awfully quiet. I wonder if it’s just a calm before the storm.
SPCX1685*#*Elizabeth is so happy I am back. She is talking about the wedding all the time. Yet I can’t think about anything else than catching the creature. I need to get some weapons.
SPCX1686*#*I know he will come. He won’t rest until he destroys all I love. Please take care of the preparations for the wedding. I can't concentrate on anything else than the fight with the fiend.
SPCX1687*#*Today is the wedding day. My suit is clean and ironed and my pistol is loaded. Send your men to mingle among the guests and make sure they are armed.
SPCX1688*#*Captain, we have a problem! There are too many guests who don’t eat meat. I don’t understand what can someone dislike about a good steak. But try to get some alternative.
SPCX1689*#*And now my suit pants got torn. I tried to look behind those bushes. I thought I heard something from there. I can’t meet Elizabeth in front of the altar with a hole in my pants. Do something!
SPCX169*#*The ship we will be sailing on is carrying a cargo of wine to Ireland. However there is a problem, they don’t have enough barrels to store the wine in.
SPCX1690*#*The whole wedding was really tiring. But I am glad all went well. Yet if nothing happened until now, we must be even more cautious. Watch Elizabeth while I search the grounds.
SPCX1691*#*No! He’s got her! The monster managed to get inside her room and now the door is locked tight. We must get inside now. Do something! Break the window with a rock!
SPCX1692*#*No, no, no! My love, how could this have happened? Elizabeth, you can’t be dead. Run after the monster, shoot it, kill it!
SPCX1693*#*Now that Elizabeth is dead I have nothing to lose. I will give all I have to catch the monster. Help me, captain. You are the only one I have left now.
SPCX1694*#*It’s not the monster this time. He passed away from old age and grief. He loved Elizabeth as his own daughter. Come to the funeral, but make sure your sailors are ready should the creature appear.
SPCX1695*#*A fisherman at the docks told me he saw an unusually large man board a ship headed for the Arctic. Get a warm cloak, pack some food, and let’s go after him.
SPCX1696*#*We will have a better chance to find the creature if we take different routes. You take your ship to the west and I will find a passage to the east. Good luck and be careful. Take a pistol or two with you.
SPCX1697*#*And here we are. In the cold north, as cold as my heart after the creature I created killed my loved ones. But not just my heart is cold. Can you sew these rabbit furs together? I am freezing.
SPCX1698*#*I should never have ventured into the north without you. It was foolish. But I was so close I almost got him. Do you have some skis with you? We might catch his trace again.
SPCX1699*#*The monster has a big advantage. He does not need to eat or keep warm. The furs are keeping the cold away but my belly is growling furiously. Maybe we could catch some fish if we break the ice.
SPCX170*#*We have packed food for us and have not thought of the good sailors. Get some fish for them too so they won’t take us for ungrateful passengers.
SPCX1700*#*The men want to turn around? I understand it is cold here but we must pursue the fiend. Pay them double to keep them here, I will return the money to you soon.
SPCX1701*#*The ship got trapped in ice. We can’t move forward or back. We need to try to break the ice around the ship. Send all the men down.
SPCX1702*#*We have been stuck here for days now. The cold has already killed a few men and food is getting sparse too. We could not break the ice to catch fish last time. You will have to go further south and try again.
SPCX1703*#*We must turn south. Our ship won’t be able to hold out against the pressure of the ice for much longer. Maybe if we give our guys a few pickaxes, they will be able to break the ice around the ship.
SPCX1704*#*I don’t think we can find the monster. I am so cold, captain. If we don’t get to warmer waters soon, I am afraid what will happen. I can’t feel my toes anymore. Can you mend my socks? They are full of holes.
SPCX1705*#*We have burned all the furniture and equipment we could. We need fire to warm up and stay alive. I am afraid we will have to start taking down the ship to feed the fire in the stove.
SPCX1706*#*I have this creepy feeling, captain, that something is watching us. Could it be that the creature is hiding on the ship? Tell everyone to have their eyes open.
SPCX1707*#*Are we heading south? I can’t feel the cold anymore. Is that a good thing, captain? I can’t move my fingers at all, I think they are frozen. I am afraid I might not see the end of this voyage.
SPCX1708*#*Help! We have been attacked. Send a boat for us before the savages kill us all!
SPCX1709*#*Thank God you were around. A few of my men are still on the beach. Please send some of your sailors to help them. They are good men, I would feel horrible if I left them here to die.
SPCX171*#*I have a friend here in the port. He is a blacksmith and needs iron for his craft. I have promised to find him a supplier in Ireland. Can you help him in the meantime?
SPCX1710*#*This has been a really unsuccessful trade voyage. We were supposed to buy spices from the natives. But something must have made them angry. Now I don’t have the money, nor the spices.
SPCX1711*#*Well, thank you, captain. We could try to buy some spices with the money you gave me on another island. But I am not sure if we want to risk a new attack. I will leave the decision to you.
SPCX1712*#*Let’s not take any more risks and head back to Amsterdam. I don’t look forward to explaining this to the company. If I could at least get some precious materials, that might placate them a bit.
SPCX1713*#*This was actually my first contract for the VOC. Don’t you know the Dutch East Indies Company? If you want to mean something in the sea trade, you have to be one of them. I’ll tell you about it while we eat.
SPCX1714*#*I am not a fan of weapons so I went completely unarmed on this mission. It might have been a mistake. Next time I will take at least a kitchen knife to the negotiations. I have learned my lesson.
SPCX1715*#*You can come with me. I will introduce you to the higher-ups. They might even give you a contract too when I tell them how you helped me. Just wear something more respectable.
SPCX1716*#*VOC needs a lot of captains to sail to the Indies right now. The spice trade is flourishing. We can sail together to Batavia, the capital of Dutch East Indies, as soon as our fleet is in shape.
SPCX1717*#*I got a contract for 10 years in Batavia. I can’t leave my wife alone here for so long. She will come with me. I will introduce you tonight. You can let your sailors take care of the preparations.
SPCX1718*#*We will be away for a long time and I will need some money for the life in Batavia. I think we should sell our house here. It’s not exactly new, so we could renovate it a little before selling it.
SPCX1719*#*Selling a house is no easy task. I will leave it in the care of a friend. Maybe he can sell it while we are gone. I should probably bring him a bottle of wine or something for the trouble.
SPCX172*#*You know my friend blacksmith already, right? He needs help renovating his forge. Could you provide the materials needed for the renovation?
SPCX1720*#*My wife has never been on such a long voyage. But I bet if she has her favorite food, she will enjoy the time at sea. Let’s just hope she doesn’t get the seasickness.
SPCX1721*#*Weigh the anchor, captain, and let’s head for Batavia. I have been there before. It’s a lovely exotic town full of coconut trees, wooden houses, and colorful flowers. Just beware of the mosquitos.
SPCX1722*#*Welcome to Batavia, our new home. I have bought a house in town with the help of one of my friends here. I advise you do the same. Houses are pretty cheap here and it is a good investment.
SPCX1723*#*A lovely house you have here. It’s a bit smaller than ours but you are at sea most of the time anyway, right, captain? Now just to fill it with some furniture. I know an excellent local carpenter.
SPCX1724*#*I am building a small pool in my garden. This hot weather just asks for a cooldown in the water. Do you want to help? I promise I will invite you for a pool party once it’s finished.
SPCX1725*#*I had a meeting with the Council of the Indies this morning. They are sending me on an expedition. You can come with us, captain. I know you love adventure. Just gather your sailors and we can set out to sea.
SPCX1726*#*I know you must be dying from curiosity. So bring a bottle of wine and I will tell you about our mission. But keep it to yourself. The VOC likes to keep their plans secret.
SPCX1727*#*We are going to explore the Beach. This is the northern part of Terra Australis or New Holland, as we call it. I will show it to you on the map. But first let’s take a break, I got hungry from all the talking.
SPCX1728*#*We are ready to set sails. Before you join me, make sure your fleet is busy. The Council requested a shipment of iron scheduled in a few weeks. Make the arrangements and let’s go.
SPCX1729*#*The VOC is financing this expedition but they are skimpy. We can hardly pay the crew with what they gave us. Of course, once we return with something valuable the reward will be worth it.
SPCX173*#*Do you know the weather in Ireland can be quite unpleasant? We will need a pair of fine woolen cloaks. I expect that they will not be cheap.
SPCX1730*#*We have now been at sea for almost a month. I would welcome solid ground under my feet again. And we need to refill our water supplies. Tell the men to look out for land.
SPCX1731*#*There! Let’s anchor in the bay. This island looks pretty large and green. I bet there will be a river or two. And we could also use some timber to repair the ships.
SPCX1732*#*We must continue east. Don’t forget to send a part of your fleet back to Batavia. The VOC is expecting shipments of resources we find on this voyage. Look out for precious stones, metal ores, or exotic woods.
SPCX1733*#*We must have ventured too far south. I did not expect a snowstorm on this expedition. I have no warm clothing with me. Set the course northeast and bring something that will warm us up.
SPCX1734*#*The weather has calmed and look there! Can you see it? It’s the first land we have sighted in the Southern Sea. The waters here are full of fish. We should make use of this and replenish food supplies.
SPCX1735*#*Let’s get a bit closer to the island so we can have a better look. However, we should continue north. Do you have a working compass? Mine fell into the water yesterday.
SPCX1736*#*I will record this as Van Diemen’s Land. Mr. Van Diemen sponsored this expedition, so we should honor him by naming this land after him. Still, he could have been a bit more generous with the money.
SPCX1737*#*We are supposed to claim this land for the Dutch so we will have to anchor in the bay in front of us. Prepare the Dutch flag. Make sure the pole is sturdy and stays up even in the coming storm.
SPCX1738*#*This storm blows us away from the bay each time we want to enter. And I have seen a lot of rocks in the water. If we want to plant that flag on the beach, a few men will have to swim there.
SPCX1739*#*Can you accompany the sailors swimming to the beach and make sure they fasten the flag among the rocks? The sand could be easily washed away by the sea. I know I can trust you to take care of it.
SPCX174*#*Some sailors from our ship have gotten sick. They have probably eaten something foul. How can we set sail now without the full crew on board?
SPCX1740*#*Good job, captain. Now we can sail on. But first, come into my cabin. We should drink to our first discovery on this voyage.
SPCX1741*#*The winds are unfavorable here. We can’t continue north. We must go east. If you spot some fish, make sure you have a harpoon on hand. We are running out of supplies again.
SPCX1742*#*Any luck with the fish? I think the ones we acquired during the last fishing stop have gotten foul. I have enough trouble trying to keep the course. If I fail, the winds will blow us who knows where.
SPCX1743*#*I see land ahead again. I guess this will be the southern tip of the South Americas. There is supposed to be an island there. Do you think there will be some people willing to sell us food and water?
SPCX1744*#*The supplies of fresh water are depleted. We either find people willing to sell us some or we need to get to a river. Let’s get the empty barrels on a boat and head for the island.
SPCX1745*#*We have been attacked! Call the men back! We are not equipped to fight the natives and we don’t want to make enemies anyway. We should avoid them if possible.
SPCX1746*#*They have killed a few of our men. Let’s look for a better place for landing. We must find water or we will all die. We can bury the unlucky lads on the other side of the island.
SPCX1747*#*They were good men, fine sailors, and loving husbands. We will honor them by naming this shore the Murderer’s Bay so that everyone knows what happened here. Now let’s have a toast to our fallen comrades!
SPCX1748*#*It’s time we head back to Batavia. We have made some discoveries and regretfully lost a few men. But Board of VOC will want to see material results. We should take some of the ore we found near the shore.
SPCX1749*#*We have scratched some rocks under water. We need to send out survey boats to check the water ahead. Select a few men who will take care of it. This is a dangerous terrain.
SPCX175*#*I have found some beautiful green gems on the shore. I have no need of them but maybe you can find a use for them. I will sell them to you for a good price.
SPCX1750*#*We made it but it was not easy. The men did a good job navigating us between the rocks. Let’s make them a nice dinner from the remaining supplies. We should be home soon anyway.
SPCX1751*#*It seems nothing has changed here. I am in a hurry to get home to my wife. But then we should freshen up a bit and go visit the Council. They are surely waiting impatiently for a report from us.
SPCX1752*#*If you have something interesting from our expedition, be sure to bring it with you. The Council will be interested in all records and notes we have made. Pack it all in a box and let’s go.
SPCX1753*#*So we have failed. At least in the eyes of the Council. We have brought no promising trade partners or new trade routes. That’s all they have interest in. It made me kind of frustrated. Let’s go get a drink.
SPCX1754*#*Do you have some materials from the voyage back on your ship? I need to convince the Company to sponsor another voyage. I know there are still important things to discover.
SPCX1755*#*Round up the guys! We are going on a second voyage. We will have three ships so make sure we have enough people to have a full crew in all of them.
SPCX1756*#*Let’s take some weapons this time. We can’t get deterred by a few armed natives. Most of our sailors are not very experienced with a weapon, but I will feel safer if we have them.
SPCX1757*#*Our ships are in a surprisingly good shape after the last voyage. We need only to get supplies of fresh water and food and we are ready to go. I hope we can make a significant discovery this time.
SPCX1758*#*We are going to map the eastern coast of New Holland. We need to find any notes or maps concerning the coast made by previous explorers. Just have some money at hand, they won’t give it to us for free.
SPCX1759*#*There should be a passage to the east somewhere between these islands. Let’s send out a few boats to survey the area here. From here I can see only rocky reefs and islands scattered around.
SPCX176*#*We should have been on the way already, unfortunately the ship is not new and needs some repairs. If we help with the material the ship will be seaworthy soon enough.
SPCX1760*#*We must have missed the passage. We are already on the rocky shores of New Holland. Let’s follow the coast. But we must be extremely careful not to hit a reef.
SPCX1761*#*I have started drawing a precise map of the coast. Will you take a look at it tonight? Maybe you remember some more details about the coast. A glass of wine might help your memory.
SPCX1762*#*There are some people on the shore. I have seen smoke rising up to the sky. I am thinking of sending a few guys to explore the place, but we should stay here where it’s safe. What do you think?
SPCX1763*#*Everything went smoothly and our sailors even got some metal items as presents. The natives have access to iron ore and they don’t want to kill us. This here has the potential to become a good business.
SPCX1764*#*Let’s give the natives some food in return and head home. We have made some new contacts and mapped the northern coast. Originally we were headed east but I still think these are good results.
SPCX1765*#*The VOC Council was happy. I was even voted to be the new member of the Council of Justice. We ought to celebrate that in my favorite inn. I would pay for it, but I have not yet received my pay.
SPCX1766*#*I think I can afford to rebuild the house now. My wife wants to have kids and our house is too small for that. With the new position on the Council, I will be spending more time here with family.
SPCX1767*#*My wife is pregnant, I hope it will be a son. I will give him a wooden rudder to play with and make a proper sailor out of him. My place is here now but there are still more adventures for you out there.
SPCX1768*#*A nice day at the sea, right? I am Captain Seaport but everyone calls me Uncle. Yes, you heard that right. This beautiful port here carries my name. How about you invite me for a drink, captain?
SPCX1769*#*I have come to inspect what you have done with my port. It’s been two years since I left this humble village and hoped an able sailor will transform it into something amazing.
SPCX177*#*Now our ship is ready to set sails. Let’s have one last dinner in my homeland. Who knows when I will get back again.
SPCX1770*#*Let me take a look. The fishermen are working, that’s good. Let’s test the quality of the fish. I like them so fresh you can feel them wriggling in your belly.
SPCX1771*#*I am curious what kind of sailors have you hired. Are they hard working and strong? I hope they know a few sailor songs. Bring them to the Tavern, I would like to meet them.
SPCX1772*#*They are fine lads and lasses you got here. No wonder your port is in such a good shape. I must have drunk a bit too much. Do you have a free bed here? I will continue the inspection tomorrow.
SPCX1773*#*I am so hungry I could eat a whale. Do you have some breakfast for your honored guest? If you have no whale, you can buy some bread and cheese. That will do.
SPCX1774*#*These are some fine ships. But are they tied properly? Here, let me show you how to tie a proper sailor's knot. Just don’t get tangled up in the rope.
SPCX1775*#*I admit you have built a nice port out of what I left you. But I did pretty well myself. It’s a pity I had to leave it all behind. Do you want to know how it all began? So listen!
SPCX1776*#*At the beginning there were trains. I loved trains since I was a little boy. And when I got older I started working on a railway construction. I had to take care of large shipments of iron every day.
SPCX1777*#*It was no easy job. But at least I earned some money. Soon I began to miss my home, the peaceful fishing village, sea breeze, and the incessant cawing of the seagulls.
SPCX1778*#*One day when I was digging a trench for the railroad I thought to myself, why not try a different business? I did round up some guys who were working with me and we got our heads together.
SPCX1779*#*I grew up in a small village on the shore. I was always close to the sea. And as I was standing on the beach one day with a fishing rod in hand, I realized that this is where I want to stay.
SPCX178*#*I have made a great deal! My friend has promised to give me his old furniture which we can use in the ship’s cabin if we bring him some spare metal. Do you have some?
SPCX1780*#*During days, I worked on the railroad and in the evenings I studied ship design. After I had enough money, I bought timber from the village lumberjack and started the construction of my first ship.
SPCX1781*#*It did not go without some troubles. Our first ship got untied during a windy night, drifted to the open sea and we never saw her again. That’s when I decided to learn to tie a proper sailing knot.
SPCX1782*#*However, the villagers did not like my plans. They were fishermen by heart and feared the big ships would scare the fish away. We promised them more money from the trading business but to no avail.
SPCX1783*#*So I came up with the idea to build my own port. I started with building a house for me and my future sailors mates. The house later became the Town Hall and I the mayor.
SPCX1784*#*It was then that I realized what a large project this is. We needed food and materials and more people to help out. And we were also missing a Sawmill to produce the wood for ships and men who would build it.
SPCX1785*#*I promised a few fishermen from our village a bright future in my port. They would join us if we build them a fishing pier. We had enough wood from the Sawmill so we just needed a few axes to get started.
SPCX1786*#*And then I got a message from my mom. Dad got sick and someone needed to take over our fish farm. I untied one fishing boat from the pier and hurried home.
SPCX1787*#*Don’t think it was an easy decision. There was still too much work here. I did not have enough money to build all that was needed. And when your folks need you, you must go.
SPCX1788*#*I returned back to my birth village, Neighborhood. You can find it on your map. If you ever feel like your fishermen are not keeping up, just pay me a visit there and I will help you out.
SPCX1789*#*Anyway, I had started something great here and I could not just let it all go to waste. That’s where you came into play. I gave you an easy task to build the docks to test you out.
SPCX179*#*You have been a good friend and a trustworthy companion to me. All I need from you now is to help me sweeten up this trip for me and the sailors who will take us there.
SPCX1790*#*And you proved yourself. You had salt water in your veins and an anchor in your heart. You would take care of my port like it was your own child. I did well in choosing you, captain.
SPCX1791*#*And that’s how it happened. I could have made my story much longer, but I know you are busy with the port business. So let’s continue the inspection. How about we check out your blacksmith?
SPCX1792*#*I know that guy from the time we first came here. It’s good that you built him a foundry. He can work much more efficiently now. Don’t forget to upgrade his workshop regularly.
SPCX1793*#*You know what? I am really hungry. Let’s go check out that Tavern of yours. In my day, we had no such establishment. But I can see how that improves the morale of your sailors.
SPCX1794*#*I can see your port is flourishing. But how are you doing financially? I could use a small loan for my fish farm back at Neighborhood. I promise to supply you with fish whenever you need.
SPCX1795*#*There is just one more thing I am curious about. And that is your fleet. Let’s get to the docks. I hope there is a ship being built, I would love to watch the construction.
SPCX1796*#*Your fleet is truly impressive. I would like to get a passage on that newest ship of yours. I believe she is missing only an anchor and then she can take me back home.
SPCX1797*#*It was great to see my little port grow into this wonderful town. You have done well, captain. I will now return to my village but maybe we will see each other again.
SPCX1798*#*Sorry to scare you like that. We are just loading up the supplies for our expedition. Wouldn’t want to knock you down into the water. If you’ve got the time, will you lend us a hand?
SPCX1799*#*You are wondering what are those metal jars we are loading up, right? Those are tin cans, they can keep food fresh for a long time. But you need a sturdy crate to store them in, they are pretty heavy.
SPCX180*#*At last we can set sails. I must admit nothing but a few planks between me and the deep water makes me a bit nervous. But I will endure that so I can follow my dream.
SPCX1800*#*Do you see that ship tied up at the pier? That’s Hecla, my beauty that will take me to the icy north. Let’s take the supplies inside. If you could call your shipmates to help us out, I will pay you all well.
SPCX1801*#*You are a captain too, right? We could use one more ship to accompany us. What do you say, interested? I am starving right now but after I get something to eat, I will tell you about our mission.
SPCX1802*#*Our mission is to look for a Northwest Passage to the Pacific, going as far north as possible. If you want to go with us, you better strengthen your ship against ice and build some stoves to keep warm.
SPCX1803*#*Warm clothing is essential. I always take my favorite fur gloves with me. When you have to hold the rudder in a snowstorm, you will find out how important they are.
SPCX1804*#*We will be gone for Christmas too. You better buy some gifts for your friends and let them be delivered on the Christmas Eve. When that’s done we can set the course for the Arctic.
SPCX1805*#*It’s getting colder by the hour as we continue north. Don’t forget to load the stoves with firewood so your sailors can find some warmth inside.
SPCX1806*#*I am getting really hungry. I think it’s time we tasted the food from the tin cans. We will need some hammer and chisel to open them. I hope it will be worth all the effort.
SPCX1807*#*It tasted a bit strange but I am full so that’s good. We are already reaching the ice fields. I am afraid we will have to search for a place to stay during the winter. Have your men keep a lookout.
SPCX1808*#*This bay looks like a good place to overwinter. It’s sheltered from the north wind by that cliff. Let’s try catching some fish here. That could keep us fed during the long winter months.
SPCX1809*#*There is not much to work with but maybe we can build some small cabin from the rocks on the beach. We don’t need much, most of the men can sleep in the ships.
SPCX181*#*Finally we are here! It’s just as I remember it. The lush green pastures with sheep, low hills and grey clouds overhead. Despite the past I am glad to be back.
SPCX1810*#*A few men already have frostbite on their fingers. I have ordered regular exercises to get everyone warmed up. But check if you have some spare gloves on your ship. We can’t return with a fingerless crew.
SPCX1811*#*I don’t know how many days it’s been now since I last saw the sun. It’s dark all the time. I hope we have enough wood for the fire to keep us warm and give us a bit of light.
SPCX1812*#*I heard there are people living here. Unbelievable, right? If we find them, we could buy some more wood and maybe fresh food from them. Our supplies are diminishing fast.
SPCX1813*#*Select a few adventurous men who will go seek the Inuits. That’s what they call themselves, these cold-loving people. I hope we will find them, we could use their help.
SPCX1814*#*There are first signs of scurvy among the crew. I have some mustard and cress seeds. If we could get a bit of soil, I could grow them in my cabin. Try to dig out some from underneath the snow.
SPCX1815*#*I hope the scouting party finds the Inuits because we are running low on the food supplies. Let’s issue more men to the fishing squad. If it comes to worst, at least we will have seafood.
SPCX1816*#*At least we don’t have to worry about the food going foul in this cold. It’s like a giant fridge here. But we should make some small shed for the fish, I bet there are some hungry animals prowling around.
SPCX1817*#*The scouting party has found the Inuits and brought some seal meat and furs from them. That should help us for a while. I will need to sew new gloves from the leather, mine are getting rather rugged.
SPCX1818*#*I want to go meet the Inuits. They must know the terrain here best. Maybe they can tell us if it’s possible to continue north from here once the ice thaws. But we will each need a pair of snowshoes.
SPCX1819*#*I heard from our men that the Inuits are very friendly. I am sure they would give us the information for free but I know they have hard lives here. So let’s give them a bit of gold.
SPCX182*#*I have come to teach and help the people of Ireland and for this I will need a building where the people will find me. The hill over there seems like a nice spot for it.
SPCX1820*#*We should leave the men some clear orders before we leave. So that we will be ready to set out when the ice begins to thaw. And a few of the scouts will have to show us the way to the Inuits.
SPCX1821*#*Take a few of the tin cans as a gift with us. I think there are some left in the storage room. And don’t forget the chisel and hammer or else they won’t be able to open them.
SPCX1822*#*There! I can see the village already. I hope they have some food for us. I am starving. Just please no seal fat, I can’t stomach that thing.
SPCX1823*#*Do you see their homes? They are made of ice. How can they live inside that? It must be freezing. Do we still have some stone on your ship? We could build them at least one proper house.
SPCX1824*#*Do you understand what they are saying? No? Me neither. I hope they have someone who speaks our language. How else could our scouts communicate with them?
SPCX1825*#*Ok, we were invited inside the igloo. Am I pronouncing it correctly? That’s what they called it, right? Everything is from ice here. I think I need second gloves. Do you have some spare ones?
SPCX1826*#*There is a fireplace here. Let’s make a fire while we wait. I hope somebody will come soon. Hmm, do you think the house will thaw once we light up the fire? I am freezing, so let's take that risk.
SPCX1827*#*Our party back at the harbor may be worried. We should send a few guys back with the news that we are ok. Oh! Someone is coming. It’s a girl!
SPCX1828*#*Hello, I am Elisapee. We have some warm food for you. It’s caribou stew, it’s very good. Take a bowl and eat.
SPCX1829*#*You are in our town Igloolik. You were lucky to have found us. You are with the men that were here before, right? We have some arctic char if you want some more food.
SPCX183*#*I am sure you know of the slimy slithering creatures overrunning this fair country. The beasts attacked me! Would you believe it? I could use some help keeping them away.
SPCX1830*#*So you want to know about the sea. We don’t venture out there much. It’s dangerous. We have made signs with rocks where the ice melts. You can follow them and place more stones to mark your passage.
SPCX1831*#*You are shaking. Are you cold? You must be used to warmer weather. Do you have something that will warm you up? Just tell me what you need and we will take care of it.
SPCX1832*#*It tastes strange but good. There are eggs in it? We can sell you more of those, but you will have to pay. We don’t have many birds here. But should you need seal fat, we can give you that for free.
SPCX1833*#*Your friend is in a hurry to get back. But we could use some help if you have the time. We are preparing a winter feast. Our men are gone hunting and we need more people to help out.
SPCX1834*#*First, we need to collect wood for a large bonfire. We will light it in the middle of the village. It’s hard to find enough wood here, so we use dried seaweed and some other things too.
SPCX1835*#*We were lucky to find that driftwood in the bay. Since we are already here we can collect the seaweed. But be careful not to get wet, the water is freezing. Use some sticks or fishing rods.
SPCX1836*#*I see you have interesting equipment for catching fish. How about you show me how efficient it is? There are a lot of fish here but they are nimble and will avoid your special spear.
SPCX1837*#*Tell me about your winter celebration. You have one, right? Do you make the drink you prepared before? I would like some more of it, it was delicious.
SPCX1838*#*We should return to the village. Follow the stones, they will show us the way. It’s easy to get lost here when everything is white. If there were no clouds, you could also follow the stars.
SPCX1839*#*Our hunters are back from the hunt. They were successful. If you want to take some meat back to your people on the ship, you can buy it now and store it in one of the igloos.
SPCX184*#*That went well. I have chased the snakes into the sea. We should be rid of them for good. I have an idea! Let’s celebrate this victory with some tasty food.
SPCX1840*#*Call your men to come and help with cutting the meat. We need to do that while it’s still warm. Once it freezes it will be too hard to cut. I hope they are not squeamish about blood.
SPCX1841*#*We eat most of the meat raw. The cold keeps it fresh and we can’t waste wood for cooking. Fire is a luxury, we use it only in the coldest of nights. But since we have visitors we can make an exception.
SPCX1842*#*We don’t have much equipment for grilling meat, so you will have to find something. While the meat is being done, don’t you want to try our specialty? It’s called muktuk. Here, try it!
SPCX1843*#*I should have warned you it’s frozen whale skin and blubber. Sometimes I forget your tastes are quite different from ours. You should take a glass of that drink of yours to wash down the taste.
SPCX1844*#*The meat is done. Here, you will enjoy this more than our raw specialties. Since we have the fire burning already we can also grill the fish you have caught in the bay.
SPCX1845*#*The people are already gathering at the center of the village. There is a market before the celebration begins. You can buy food, leather, or furs. I am sure you will find something useful.
SPCX1846*#*You can trade some of your items here. Clothing, hunting equipment, or tableware. They would be interested in all such things. Someone might even buy decorative items, like statues or jewelry.
SPCX1847*#*Call your friends to join in the celebration. They are still eating. You can assure them there will be more food later. We will be singing songs now. You can join us or just listen.
SPCX1848*#*We are used to giving small gifts to friends and family. Kids get the most presents, of course. We make toys for them from what we can get. But they love the wooden toys most because they are so rare.
SPCX1849*#*You have not yet met the village elder. He is very wise but kind too. He loves the Quviasukvik, I mean the winter feast. He always makes toys for all the children in the village.
SPCX185*#*The villagers are good at farming but they have neglected fishing. If you find some fishermen among the sailors who sailed us here, they can teach them some tricks.
SPCX1850*#*Come, I will introduce you to him. I know he would love that egg drink of yours. He has a sweet tooth which is hard to please out here in the north.
SPCX1851*#*I can’t find him among all the people here. Have something more to eat while I look for him. But remember, most of our food is raw. If you don’t like it, you must cook it yourself.
SPCX1852*#*I have not found the elder but my mother wants to meet you. She has made a sealskin coat for you. It’s really warm and waterproof. If you give her a few coins she will make some for your men too.
SPCX1853*#*Mum just told me the neighbor’s boy is missing. He might have wandered off somewhere while playing hide and seek with the other kids. We must go look for him. Can your sailors help?
SPCX1854*#*No luck finding him yet? Try leaving stones behind you so that they will point the way to the village. All our children know to follow such a trail.
SPCX1855*#*There are dangerous animals hiding in the darkness beyond the village. But it’s all good now. He followed the trail of stones you made. Now let’s get him warmed up by the fire.
SPCX1856*#*And there he is! The older man with a big belly and white beard that is our elder. Quickly before he disappears somewhere again! Do you have the eggnog for him?
SPCX1857*#*This is my friend from beyond the frozen sea. The elder knows your language so you can speak with him freely, captain. Now I have some work to do before the celebration, so I will leave you two together.
SPCX1858*#*How do you like it here in Igloolik? Do you have everything you need? Food, warm clothing, a fine company? Don’t hesitate to ask. A visitor is always welcome among us.
SPCX1859*#*I am Nanuq, it means polar bear. They call me that because I am so big and my beard is so white. Don’t worry, I won’t eat you. But should you meet a real one, you better have a big stick with you.
SPCX186*#*Have you seen my walking stick? I have put it into ground a while back when we came here and now this tree grows here instead. It seems I will have to find a new stick.
SPCX1860*#*Anyway, I love that eggy drink of yours. It warms me up even when it’s cold. It’s sad that we have run out of eggs. We make a herbal tea to warm us up. I don’t have any but you can buy it on the market.
SPCX1861*#*So do you want to help me with the gifts? I am on a tight schedule right now. Usually, the women from the village help me make the toys and presents. But this year they were too busy.
SPCX1862*#*You brought all your friends here. That’s great! We will be able to make a ton of presents in no time. Now we just need some materials to work with. Anything will do.
SPCX1863*#*Hmm, stone toys might be a bit dangerous for little kids. They like to throw things around. But don’t worry, we will just wrap them up in a bit of fur. Look if you have some other material too.
SPCX1864*#*Wood is much better and it gave me an idea. You know what our children love the most? Sledding. It’s the favorite pastime of all little Inuits.
SPCX1865*#*The kids will love it. Now, this is a hard task. The winter feast would be nothing without some sweet treats. I will get the ingredients and you find a way how to bake it without burning it to ashes.
SPCX1866*#*Perfect! You must have baked at home too, right? But we can’t let the kids eat their dessert before some healthy meal.
SPCX1867*#*We have fish and meat now but we need some veggies too. Go buy some seaweed and berries from the market. There is not much fruit or vegetables growing here but we will have to make do with what we have got.
SPCX1868*#*Now we are ready to go and give out the food and presents to each family in Igloolik. We are not a big village but it will take some time if it’s just the two of us.
SPCX1869*#*If we load the presents on sleds, we can deliver them much faster. I will borrow a few reindeer from my friends to do the hard work. I have only one reindeer myself, he has a really funny red nose.
SPCX187*#*Oh no! My cloak got torn. Could you buy me a new one? Remember I prefer wearing the color green. It reminds me of the shamrock growing on the green hills of Ireland.
SPCX1870*#*We have a problem, mate. One of the sleds got trapped in the deep snow. We need to use some solid support to get it back on track.
SPCX1871*#*We have almost freed the sled now. We just need to shovel the snow away and the reindeer will be able to pull it out of the hole. They are really strong animals.
SPCX1872*#*Both you and the reindeer did well. We managed to free the sled and deliver all the presents. You deserve some food to replenish your energy and I will get some hay for our four-legged friends.
SPCX1873*#*Now we have a bit of time before the unpacking of the presents. How about I show you how we build our igloos. We will need a large ice pick for that.
SPCX1874*#*The ice pick is really sharp. I think I have some bandage somewhere. Maybe you should disinfect it too. The village shaman has some medicine, but it’s not cheap.
SPCX1875*#*The time of presents is here! It does not matter what you get or what you give. It‘s all about the generosity and a good time with family and friends. I have something for you too.
SPCX1876*#*I have not received so much stone as a gift before! Ho ho ho, it was a surprise for sure! Thank you for that, my friend. Now I think it’s time you returned back home. Let’s pack your things on the sled.
SPCX1877*#*It’s time to say goodbye. I hope all your sailors have found a place on the sleds. The reindeer are ready to take you back to your ships. Don’t worry about them, they will find their way home.
SPCX1878*#*Are you in a hurry to get Christmas presents for everyone? I am doing the same. But some wishes are just too strange. I can't find a graceful fish statue. I will probably have to make it myself.
SPCX1879*#*You look like a true sea wolf, tell me, do you know how to catch fish? I am standing here with a fishing rod in hand for hours and still nothing. And I think my fingers have frozen already.
SPCX188*#*The people in this village live from cultivating the land. You can see it also on their tools which are all pretty worn out. We should get them some new ones.
SPCX1880*#*Is it normal that my fingers are blue like this? I think that might be bad. I have forgotten my gloves before I went fishing. That was a big mistake.
SPCX1881*#*In winter season I always venture into the icy north and meet my Inuit friends. Each time I bring them a useful gift. This year I plan on building a small stove which can be heated up by burning oil.
SPCX1882*#*You still have all your toes, captain? I will give you a priceless advice. Warm up some stones over the fire and put them in your socks. It is a true toe saver.
SPCX1883*#*What are you doing in these iceberg filled waters? Are you fishing for whales? Confess! I am their guardian and I won’t allow such cold murder. Give me all your harpoons, now!
SPCX1884*#*Just a second, sailor! Do you see those poor penguins? They have not enough rocks to build a nest for their eggs. Soon some hungry bird will snatch them away. We can’t let that happen!
SPCX1885*#*There are still so many presents to buy and Christmas decorations to make, not to mention sweets to bake. I am exhausted and all out of money. How do you manage it so well, captain?
SPCX1886*#*This Inuit village has been attacked by polar bears more than once. We need to protect the people and keep the bears out of harm's way too. Will you help me build a fence around the village?
SPCX1887*#*Do you know why bears go to villages? They are hungry and people throw away a lot of food. But if we prepare an easy snack for the furry mutts outside the village, everyone will be happy.
SPCX1888*#*It’s you, captain. How are you doing? Still exploring the Arctic sea? Do you care to take a break and enjoy the Christmas time with me? I know just the right thing for that.
SPCX1889*#*I am delivering the Christmas presents to my village but my ship started taking on water. I think the iceberg we scratched must have breached the hull. It’s just a short distance along the coast now.
SPCX189*#*After all this work I have become quite hungry.  I love corned beef and cabbage. The corned beef is actually just salted, no corn included. But fish will do as well.
SPCX1890*#*Those are no rocks you can step on. These are penguin eggs. They have rolled out of the nests due to heavy wind. Poor penguins don’t have enough rocks to build a proper nest on this beach.
SPCX1891*#*You are a long way from home. I hope your ship did not hit an iceberg and sunk. Come, you can get warm in my cabin. I will load some firewood into the stove.
SPCX1892*#*My name is Polly Prescott. I am a marine biologist researching the Penguins here. I can offer you a hot cup of tea but I don’t have much food. If you are hungry, you can try to catch some fish.
SPCX1893*#*So you are a captain? And where is your ship? I have just a small boat here and right now the winds are too strong to go out to the open sea. But a ship with supplies should arrive in a few weeks.
SPCX1894*#*I have been alone here for five weeks. I hope you don’t mind staying here with me for a while. I love the penguins but with no people around I can feel a bit lonely.
SPCX1895*#*So your crew is here too. There is not enough room for all of you in my cabin but I can borrow you my heater. If you have some metal pans aboard, heat them up and warm up the bunks with them.
SPCX1896*#*Since you are already here, how about you help me feed the penguins? The main course of the penguin diet is krill. It is getting sparse due to water contamination. So I have made a krill farm in the bay.
SPCX1897*#*Take a bucket and fill it up with the water from the krill nursery. Krill are small creatures living in the water and the nursery is full of them. You are sure to catch a lot of them with your bucket.
SPCX1898*#*Penguins are friendly birds. But I always make sure to release the krill into the water from where they can’t see me so they don’t get used to being fed by me. So hide behind those rocks over there.
SPCX1899*#*The penguins will find the krill in the water easily now. But I noticed one penguin chick with a wounded wing. We should take him to the cabin and treat the wound. Let’s lure him with some tasty fish.
SPCX190*#*The rain has been going on for some days now. We will need to build some barriers to keep the water from flooding the village. I have some wood that we can use.
SPCX1900*#*Poor thing, he was probably injured by one of the birds preying on the penguin eggs. The hungry creatures will do anything to get their food. Bring me a needle, I will have to sew the wound up.
SPCX1901*#*If your sailors are willing to help, please tell them to check the other penguins for any signs of harm. But they should not try to catch them. Leave that to me.
SPCX1902*#*I think only of penguins and I did not realize that your sailors could be hurt too. I have some basic medicine in my cabin. If some of your men are hurt, I will sell you what you need for just a few coins.
SPCX1903*#*If your men are hungry, we can grill some krill. People can eat it too, we just need to fry it a bit in a pan first. It tastes almost like shrimps.
SPCX1904*#*I am a terrible host, sorry. But I hope your men are not angry I forgot about them at first. I am worried about the penguins so I can hardly think of anything else. They are disappearing somewhere.
SPCX1905*#*Maybe they went looking for a beach better suited for nesting. Here almost all small rocks were washed off into the sea during the summer. They need the rocks to build a protective wall for the eggs.
SPCX1906*#*Another possibility is that they have gone to search for more food. Let’s check the local fish. Maybe they are sick and the penguins don’t like them.
SPCX1907*#*I had about twenty penguins marked and now almost all are gone. I need to band some new ones. Don’t worry it does not hurt them. I just place a metal band on their left wing. They won’t even notice.
SPCX1908*#*I need to write down all the numbers and the characteristics of each penguin. Do you have a notebook? Mine is already full. Your sailors can keep notes too. More eyes can notice more things.
SPCX1909*#*Will you please give the notebooks to your crew and tell them to write down if they notice penguins leaving the rest of the colony? I need to find out where they are going to.
SPCX191*#*The storm has hit the village quite badly. We could use some help clearing the debris from wrecked houses and trees. Ask the sailors from the port if they will aid us.
SPCX1910*#*Let’s go inspect the banded penguins. We will need the notebook and some binoculars. I could use new ones, these have a broken glass. But good binoculars are pretty expensive.
SPCX1911*#*When you spot a banded bird on a nest, let me know. We will mark the nests with a wooden tag. And when the chicks are born, we will band them too so we can keep track of the whole family.
SPCX1912*#*You see that banded penguin over there? That’s Peng. He is the only one of the banded penguins that always returns. I guess it’s because I started feeding him. I just can’t help it, he is so adorable.
SPCX1913*#*Peng was not able to find a mate this year. Poor guy. His female left the colony together with many others. Let’s hide behind those rocks and watch him for a while.
SPCX1914*#*This does not look good. A strong wind is starting. We should return to the cabin. But first, we need to secure the tent with the monitoring station. We will need some big nails to pin it to the ground.
SPCX1915*#*Don’t you want to go check on your guys at the ship? See if they need anything. You can also collect the notebooks from them and we can check if they have seen something of interest.
SPCX1916*#*So your crew is trying to repair the ship. You have good sailors, they manage even without you there. Is there any way we can help them?
SPCX1917*#*From what I saw your ship will need a lot of wood to repair the damage done by the ice. It will be difficult to find enough wood here. I have only some firewood I use to heat up the stove.
SPCX1918*#*I can sell you some of my firewood too. It’s not of the best quality for shipbuilding, but it will do for some minor repairs. And we will have to turn down the heating. I hope you have a warm coat.
SPCX1919*#*I have found a hole in the ice a short distance from the penguin bay. Let’s go investigate it. If we place some fish around the opening, the smell should lure the penguins to come out.
SPCX192*#*Sheep from the local herd have become lost in the storm. I will go look for them. You get some money to buy new ones in case I can’t find them.
SPCX1920*#*There are penguin footprints here but none of them showed up. Let’s look around if we can find some clue where they might have gone. But be careful, test the ice before you by throwing a rock.
SPCX1921*#*There is another hole a bit to the south. Penguins are not heavy enough to break the ice there. I wonder what made it. Let’s take some of our equipment and follow the tracks.
SPCX1922*#*Penguins are slow on land. They wouldn’t be able to get far enough to escape my eye. Only if they dived. But they can stay underwater only for a few minutes. So I couldn’t figure out how they disappeared.
SPCX1923*#*Can you tell your sailors to take care of my base camp while we are gone? It won’t be for long but in case of a storm, all the shutters need to be closed.
SPCX1924*#*There! Did you see that? Something just broke the ice and appeared above the surface. And there are the penguins jumping out of the water. Put on your snowshoes and let’s hurry.
SPCX1925*#*Here are my lost penguins. They take a breather on the surface and once again they dive into the water. They must be following the whales looking for waters rich in krill and fish.
SPCX1926*#*The waters near the penguin bay have indeed become poor in sustenance. I will have to move my base camp to the new nesting location. Unfortunately, the move will cost money which I don’t have.
SPCX1927*#*I saved you after your ship got wrecked but now it seems you are my savior too, captain. If you could help me rebuild my cabin in the new place, I would be forever grateful.
SPCX1928*#*I will manage the rest myself. Now let’s go check how your sailors are progressing on the ship repairs. I am sure you long for warmer weather already.
SPCX1929*#*You are ready to go home. Your ship is seaworthy and your crew is waiting only for your word to sail out. You can leave all the notebooks here, they will be useful to me.
SPCX193*#*Now all the sheep are back in the pen. Hmm I see the fence is in need of some repairs. Let’s build a sturdier one so the sheep won’t run away again.
SPCX1930*#*A pleasure to meet you, captain. I would not bother you if it was not serious. I am a bit lost. We have been sailing in these icy waters for too long and we can’t get past this iceberg.
SPCX1931*#*Can I borrow your compass? I feel a bit embarrassed. You see, I am a cartographer. Usually, I can find my way anywhere, but these waters full of icebergs are a real challenge.
SPCX1932*#*I am looking for the Northeast Passage to China. I am sure there must be open sea somewhere north of Siberia. But what are you doing here? Let’s eat something and share our stories.
SPCX1933*#*We could use another ship in our search. What do you say? Are you prepared for the biting cold? Has your ship enough stoves and firewood? You better build a big oven if you don’t want to freeze.
SPCX1934*#*I always loved making maps, but exploration is my real passion. Looking out to the unknown and discovering places which no one has seen before. Let’s have a toast to the wonders of the explorer’s life!
SPCX1935*#*We have been trying to sail around this iceberg for days. I think we need to get down and explore it on foot. Put on a pair of snowshoes and get ready to disembark.
SPCX1936*#*Choose a few of your sailors to accompany us. It’s not good to go alone. But select the ones used to cold temperature. There will be no warm stove out there.
SPCX1937*#*Take some harpoons with you. We might happen to be on thin ice and if we are lucky, even catch a few fish. Our supplies are not getting any larger.
SPCX1938*#*Wait! Did you see that? Something moved over there. White almost like the snow around us. Do you have binoculars with you? They are not cheap but invaluable to any explorer.
SPCX1939*#*It’s an animal. And it looks like a big one. Let’s try to distract it with some fish. I do not want to get into a fight with it if we can avoid it. Throw the fish over there and let’s run away.
SPCX194*#*We have work to do again. The storm has ripped away the roof from the mayor’s house. Let’s make him a new and better one that will hold out against the weather.
SPCX1940*#*This does not look good. It’s a white bear and it’s running right at us. The fish did not get his attention at all. You better get your harpoon ready and pick up a few rocks too. Maybe we can scare him away.
SPCX1941*#*I am sad it had to come to this but we had to kill it or it would have had humans for dinner. He already had a taste of me. It’s just a scratch but I need to disinfect it. Do you have some alcohol with you?
SPCX1942*#*Someone should return to the ships with the wounded sailors and take the dead bear too. I heard bear meat is not very tasty but once we eat all our food, we will be glad to have it.
SPCX1943*#*Please just hide the bear inside a crate before the stench of blood attracts another one. I don’t think we would win such a fight again.
SPCX1944*#*Let’s continue on. Don’t forget the harpoons. We might yet encounter other dangerous beasts. And I think I am getting hungry too. We should have kept a piece of the bear with us.
SPCX1945*#*I think I might faint from hunger. Do you think the ice here is thin enough to make a hole into it? I have my icepick with me. Let’s hope we can catch some fish. I won’t even mind eating them raw.
SPCX1946*#*Do you see that? The large seals with tusks? These must be walruses. Well, I am not hungry anymore but I bet their tusks are worth a fortune. Some people believe that it will give them strength.
SPCX1947*#*It’s bad to kill the poor animals just for their tusks. They don’t want to kill us and we are not dying from hunger, so we will leave them alone. You did not have to pay me to let them be. But thank you.
SPCX1948*#*Let’s leave a sign of our passing here with the name I gave this bay, the Tusk Bay. Original, right? Do you see some big rock into which we can engrave it?
SPCX1949*#*I bet those dark clouds are bringing a storm to us. We need to hurry back to the ships. We must sail away from the iceberg or the storm will throw us against it and that will be the end of this voyage.
SPCX195*#*I have come to love chocolate. I know it’s a luxury which I can’t afford but maybe we could get some for the farmers to make them enjoy their hard work a bit more.
SPCX1950*#*We need all the men on deck and ready to face the storm. Make sure they are bundled up good. This will be a freezing situation.
SPCX1951*#*No! An iceberg made a breach into our hull. If we manage to close off the hole with some planks, we may yet get out of this alive. Bring the nails and my men will get the planks.
SPCX1952*#*The crew managed to seal the breach off but our food supplies are drenched in cold water. Most of them are suitable only for the fish.
SPCX1953*#*We managed to get through somehow. The storm is behind us and our ship is still sailing. Let’s give the men a drink to warm them up. They did well.
SPCX1954*#*We need to survey the damage and fix what we can. Let’s look if we can find a good spot to anchor. Some rocky shore would be best, I don’t like anchoring near the icebergs.
SPCX1955*#*Let’s get the ship back in shape. I have some wood below deck but I am afraid we will need more than that. The damage was pretty serious. We were lucky we did not get wrecked.
SPCX1956*#*Get everyone to work! We must finish the repair quickly before the ice closes around us and we won’t be able to leave for the next few months.
SPCX1957*#*It’s terribly cold here. All those goods we have on ships will be for nothing if we freeze on the way to China. Let’s use the cloth to sew some more clothes. Do you have any needles?
SPCX1958*#*It looks like we won’t finish the repairs in time. Ice is already closing in around the bay. We should at least fish for supplies while there is still open water.
SPCX1959*#*I promised the crew double payment if they finish the repairs in time. Well, I actually don’t have the money but it looks like I won’t need it anyway. The bay is almost frozen by now.
SPCX196*#*The villagers have become quite good at fishing. They have made a big catch and want to share it with the sailors who helped them before. Can you get them for us?
SPCX1960*#*We are stuck here. The mood is like the temperature, pretty low. Even the beer has frozen and broken the barrels. At least we still have some wine, let’s give out double wine ration today.
SPCX1961*#*I am afraid the ice will squash our ship like a ripe tomato. I hope it won’t come to that but we should not sleep on the ship, just in case. We need to build a house on land.
SPCX1962*#*You are really good at finding resources. However, I am afraid we can’t use the stone to build a house. We have nothing to hold the stones together nor the proper equipment.
SPCX1963*#*Yes, a wooden cottage is a better option. Let’s call the men from the ship, we should finish it before it gets dark. And the work will warm us up a bit too.
SPCX1964*#*I am so sick of fish already. We need some proper meat. Some animals must be living here too. Let’s make a few traps and place them around our cottage.
SPCX1965*#*Nothing was caught in the traps today either. I think we need some bait to attract the animals. And since we still have plenty of fish, let’s use them as bait.
SPCX1966*#*I can’t feel my feet. We must think of something before we lose our toes. We could use some hot stones to warm up our beds. Or put a few warmed up coins into our socks.
SPCX1967*#*We have been here for months now and the ice still holds the ship in its grip. We can’t wait any longer. Let’s build some boats and move on or we will starve and freeze here.
SPCX1968*#*Row properly, lads! You will feel warmer and we will come closer to salvation too. I promise once we get to a nice warm inn, I will pay a round for everyone.
SPCX1969*#*There! You see those boats? I bet those are some fishermen, so a village must be close. So we made it, we crossed the icy sea. Now I think this deserves a toast!
SPCX197*#*Today is a special day called Beltaine. The custom is to light fires on this day. We can start a fire in the valley behind the village. Everyone should see it from there.
SPCX1970*#*You must be a stranger in our seas. I never saw your flag before. You are in the waters of the mighty Middle Kingdom. You must pay us a tribute if you want to pass.
SPCX1971*#*I apologize for the harsh welcome but as a representative of the Emperor, I must abide his laws. If you wish to trade, I have some items that might interest you. I could use a shipment of iron ore.
SPCX1972*#*By the size of my fleet, you might assume we are sailing into a war. However, we are just a diplomatic and exploratory expedition heading for the Western Ocean. Do you know those waters?
SPCX1973*#*As some of your sailors mentioned, the Western Ocean is what you call the Indian Ocean. I have a large crew but only a few were already there. We could use a worldly captain such as yourself.
SPCX1974*#*We are looking for new trading partners, undiscovered lands, and exotic materials. Our holds are so full of goods for trade, that we might not have enough food for all of our sailors.
SPCX1975*#*We even have a special gift for an important business partner. You can take a look, he has a large cabin on one of my ships. Bring him some fresh bamboo, that will make him happy.
SPCX1976*#*You think us barbaric?! Watch your words! The Yongle Emperor loves animals. This is a large gesture of friendship from him. If you are going to be helpful, the panda may even be yours at the end.
SPCX1977*#*Let’s not talk of this anymore. The bear is taken care of. Only the Emperor has a larger cabin on a ship. Speaking of his highness, we need to finish the statues of the Emperor. Everyone we meet will get one.
SPCX1978*#*I see your sailors are quite capable. We needed such a large crew that I was forced to employ even men who have never been at sea before. Can your crew share some tips with my sailors?
SPCX1979*#*That was some good advice from your sailors. I can see we are sailing much faster now. We could make some additional paddles as you suggested to improve the speed even more.
SPCX198*#*The road to the neighboring village is in horrible state. No wonder the trade between the villages is dying off. We should be able to renovate it with a bit of coin.
SPCX1980*#*The lock on the panda’s cabin is broken. Good that the animal is too lazy to run away. Still, we should replace it with a new one quickly. I know you want to see him again, so why don’t you go?
SPCX1981*#*The wind from the east is strong. It is almost a full-blown cyclone. A few of our sails could not withstand it and the bamboo rods broke. We need to replace them.
SPCX1982*#*I got a report that pirates have attacked one of our ships. It got separated from the fleet and was vulnerable. We need to question the survivors, but first, let’s give them something to eat.
SPCX1983*#*These outlaws dare to attack my fleet! I will not just let that go so easily. I have chosen a few ships to pursue them. We don’t have a lot of munition for a fight. But a few cannonballs should do the trick.
SPCX1984*#*My ships are too large and too slow to get those pirates. But I will pay anyone who will catch them a large prize. Let that be known! And give out a few coins in advance to motivate the people.
SPCX1985*#*Wait! Before you go announce I am offering a bounty for the pirates, take some of my men with you. They may not be the most experienced sailors but they know the local language.
SPCX1986*#*Now let’s head for the scorching coast of Africa! I am sure that once we head back the pirates will be already caught. Let’s prepare them an unpleasant small cell on one of the ships.
SPCX1987*#*With a fleet of more than 300 ships, there is always something needing repairs. I have some capable shipbuilders with me. They need only some materials and they can get to work.
SPCX1988*#*We will be arriving in Africa shortly. I have heard there are many exotic animals. I must bring some back to the emperor. We have prepared a few empty cages. Now let’s catch fish to feed them with.
SPCX1989*#*Now we just need something to eat for the herbivores. It would not do to bring dead animals back home because we only had fish. I think you know the way to the Bamboo Grove already.
SPCX199*#*The fire is still burning? Unbelievable! It seems as if it cannot be put out. We should build some wall around it so it does not spread any further.
SPCX1990*#*I have a meeting with the king. Do we have all the goods ready for presentation? There is the porcelain, silk, and silver... But where is the gold? We need the gold right now!
SPCX1991*#*I have never seen some of the gifts we received from the king. Like this animal. It’s called a rhino. It’s stronger than a bull and more dangerous than a tiger. We need something solid to keep him confined.
SPCX1992*#*Where is everyone? We need to get the goods on board and set sail for home or I might get a heatstroke soon. Call the men to help with the loading and make sure they are careful with the animals.
SPCX1993*#*We should tell the other ships to keep a lookout for the pirates. Ask my attendant to show you how to use the fire signals. We use them to communicate with the whole fleet. It’s fast but a bit dangerous.
SPCX1994*#*There they are! They are still not captured or dead. How is that possible? Are all sailors in these seas incompetent? Ready your weapons, captain! We will not let them escape again.
SPCX1995*#*How could this happen? The slimy pirates have robbed us again and escaped. The Emperor must not learn about this! Such a disgrace! We need to get the gold back from somewhere.
SPCX1996*#*At least all the other goods for the Emperor are safe. All the animals remain unharmed. We need some more food for them so they will remain healthy until we arrive in the Middle Kingdom.
SPCX1997*#*I will let you in on a secret. I let the panda free in the Bamboo Grove. I hope he has enough food there. But don’t tell anyone! I wasn’t supposed to do that. Let’s just say we got some ugly statue for him.
SPCX1998*#*I must go back to my duties for the Emperor, but I can’t let the pirates roam free in our waters. We need to do something about them. I always get good ideas while cooking my favorite fish stew.
SPCX1999*#*I have come up with a solution. You will pose as a pirate and ask to join their fleet. You will make them trust you and then bring them to me and my fully armed fleet. They won’t be able to run anymore.
SPCX200*#*You have been a great help. I think I will manage on my own now. A wonderful reward is waiting for you right after I bid farewell to you over a nice dinner.
SPCX2000*#*Not so fast, captain! These waters are my territory. Only ships under me can fly the Jolly Roger here. You better come up with some good reasons for this foolishness.
SPCX2001*#*You are not completely stupid. So what do you want here? I doubt you came just to give me all your gold. You must have heard of me, Ching Shih, right? Bring me a barrel of rice wine and start talking!
SPCX2002*#*So you want to be one of my pirate captains? Do you think I take just anyone into my fleet? You must show me that you deserve it. But something pretty might help persuade me too.
SPCX2003*#*Even a pirate girl likes a nice silk dress. Fine. You want to join my fleet so I will give you a chance. A merchant ship just sailed past us. Go and get their cargo!
SPCX2004*#*A load of rocks is a pretty lousy loot. But you managed to get it quick and without unnecessary bloodshed. I can appreciate a job well done. Good, you and your men are in, captain.
SPCX2005*#*Now that you are one of us you must learn the rules. Follow them if you don’t want to end up dead. If you want to make friends here, just share your booze and food. That is pretty much all.
SPCX2006*#*I don’t like violence but we are pirates. We won’t be able to earn money by playing nicely. So get some proper weapons. And make sure you don’t hurt yourself.
SPCX2007*#*I expect you to pay me a tribute from all your loot. And don’t try to hide something from me. I have eyes and ears everywhere.
SPCX2008*#*Before you go looting, I advise getting your ships a refining touch. A dragon figurehead or black sails will do the trick. Something that will inspire fear in the regular sailors.
SPCX2009*#*Before I forget, you need to get a red flag for your ships. We are the Red Flag Fleet, everyone fears us but they respect us too. They know we don’t kill anyone without reason. Remember that.
SPCX201*#*Hello, my fellow captain. My name is Fernão Magalhães and I am planning a daring sea voyage. How about you prove me your seafaring abilities by shipping a large cargo?
SPCX2010*#*You will need a safehouse to store all your loot before you sell it. I advise using some hidden cave or an abandoned house near the shore. Just make sure it is always guarded.
SPCX2011*#*Now it’s time for the initiation ritual. Make sure all your guys and gals are here. Because if they don’t agree with all the rules and accept our tattoo now, they won’t belong to us.
SPCX2012*#*Your crew looks reliable. I hope they will prove their worth as a part of the Red Flag Fleet. Now we can relax a bit and welcome you among us with a little feast.
SPCX2013*#*I will give you the name of my fence. It’s a guy who will sell your loot for a good price. He is a bit shy but once you give him my name, he will know to trust you. He will also want a part of the profit.
SPCX2014*#*Now we will each go our way. Remember, not only gold is valuable. Art pieces or luxury furniture can be sold for good money too. You will learn what will make you rich soon enough.
SPCX2015*#*Good to see you again. How is the business going? I hope you earned a lot. We have some unpleasant business right now. I want you to assist me. We will need some heavy chains.
SPCX2016*#*A few members of the crew of captain Cheung have broken one of our basic rules. They have forced themselves on a woman. Now we must punish them.
SPCX2017*#*I don’t like to give out punishments, but we are pirates, not a grade school to give only a rebuke. Now let’s get back to making money. I need you to smuggle some silk to India.
SPCX2018*#*My contacts tell me you delivered the goods on time and without problems. You are becoming a reliable partner. You have earned yourself an invitation to my wedding. You can bring a few of your men too.
SPCX2019*#*I am marrying Cheung Po Tsai, one of my loyal captains. You know him, right? He has a large family, so we will need a lot of food and wine. But more importantly, don’t forget to bring a wedding gift.
SPCX202*#*Spain faces a critical situation. The Portuguese have blocked the path to the Indies and now we have no way of obtaining the precious spices. We need to find a new route.
SPCX2020*#*I hope those fish were only a joke. A pirate queen deserves a better wedding gift than some smelly fish. I will give you a chance to fix this mistake before I withdraw my invitation.
SPCX2021*#*How about a little chat, captain? You are not from here, right? How did you even hear about us? Tell me your story. And bring a barrel of rice wine. That makes every story more interesting.
SPCX2022*#*I am glad you don’t have problems following the rules. There are some men who miss the old ways. But I won’t allow such behavior even if I need to enforce it with steel. We are not some animals.
SPCX2023*#*Those who can’t behave join the southern pirates. They are a bunch of savages just waiting to invade our territory. We need to build more watchtowers to look out for those intruders.
SPCX2024*#*It was a fine chat, captain. I advise you to go to bed early tonight. I need you to deliver another shipment of silk tomorrow. Be ready.
SPCX2025*#*There will be a large fleet from the Middle Kingdom sailing this way in a few days. We need as many ships and men as we can gather. If we don’t mess this up, we will all become very rich.
SPCX2026*#*Today is the big day. I hope you are ready. Armed, rested and not hungry. This may cost our lives so give it everything you've got.
SPCX2027*#*Let’s go! This is our chance to get rich so fight, my pirates! Don’t hesitate to use all you’ve got. And now...Fire the cannons!
SPCX2028*#*There are too many of them. We might have overestimated ourselves. Back to the ships! I am afraid someone will have to stay here and keep the soldiers from killing our men from behind.
SPCX2029*#*Did you manage to get some gold? What? You are going to stay here and cover our retreat? If you are willing to do this, I will be forever in your debt. I hope you will survive and we will meet again.
SPCX203*#*I have a plan already. I am sure there must be a way to the Indies and the famous Spice Islands by the western route. We will succeed where Columbus failed!
SPCX2030*#*I have a cell ready for this wretched pirate. She dares to attack my fleet again! What’s that? Do you have her and her accomplices tied up in those bags?
SPCX2031*#*These are just stones! Are you making fun of me? You let the pirates escape so they can attack us again?
SPCX2032*#*At least you took their gunpowder so they can’t shoot at us. But why did you let them go? Explain this to me! And I want to talk to your crew too so I can be sure you are not making up something.
SPCX2033*#*So she is a good pirate? I did not think anything like that exists. I need to think about this during dinner. I still have not decided that I won’t throw you into prison. So don’t get too comfortable yet!
SPCX2034*#*It’s true that if we arrest Ching Shih someone else will just take her place. It might make things even worse. But we won’t just let her steal our gold. We will be ready when she comes next.
SPCX2035*#*I have decided. Take this message to her. If she gives up her career, I will leave her alone. But I expect her to return a part of what she stole. You will bring me the money or her head!
SPCX2036*#*You took the money from your own reserves, didn’t you? I doubted that she would agree to that. But if you are ready to pay her dues, I don’t mind. What did she say to my other demands?
SPCX2037*#*She wants to open a gambling den? This is not what I had in mind when I wanted her to change career. But if she builds it somewhere far away from the Middle Kingdom, I guess I will allow it.
SPCX2038*#*You must really like her, to help her so much. She is beautiful, isn’t she? But you better keep an eye on her. I don’t have time for that now. I must prepare for the upcoming New Year’s celebration.
SPCX2039*#*You have solved this pirate problem in your own way but I think the results are satisfactory. Now let’s attend to more pleasant matters like the New Year’s dinner.
SPCX204*#*We will need at least 5 ships for the voyage. The fleet must be able to withstand a difficult journey. Can you take care of the material for the ships?
SPCX2040*#*Howdy, matey! Ya a sailor too? Gimme some advice, can ya? No capt’n wans to take me aboard. They all says I yam good fer nothin’. Tha’s not true, I tell ya.
SPCX2041*#*Ya arre right. A sailor should know how to catch fish. Gimme th’ fishin’ rod, I will try it meself. Just show me how to throw th’ hook.
SPCX2042*#*Blasted thing! I still haven’t caught nothin’. Somethin’ must be wrong with yer finishn’ rod. Let’s try to fish out there on th’ sea. Ya have a boat?
SPCX2043*#*Th’ boat’s here but who will row us out to th’ sea? I’ve been throwin’ the hook into th’ water fer an hour or so. Me arms hurt already.
SPCX2044*#*Great! Here must be lots an’ lots of fishes. And if I cans not catch them the traditional way, I will just trow a rock at them. Then ya swim to get them before they sink.
SPCX2045*#*This work makes one hungry. Ya have somethin’ to eat, capt’n? I still haven’t caught even a tiny little fishy.
SPCX2046*#*Wat’s dis green stuff? Ya thinks I yam a cow and eat grass? I yam disgustipated. Let’s go to th’ Rowdy House. Best restrant in th’ town. Ya have some money?
SPCX2047*#*They have th’ best burgers here. Gimpy, me friend, loves them. And that dark-haired beauty over there is Olga. She is somethin’ special. I will show her how much fish I caught. Can ye lend me some?
SPCX2048*#*She didn’t like th’ fish. They waz fresh, right? I don’t understands women. Maybe a nice bracelet will be better. Like the police have. Every girl is crazy about the policemen, right?
SPCX2049*#*Ah ye sabatage me. She did not like those bracelets either. Oh no! There goes Bruto the Brute. Olga’s boyfriend. But not fer long. Gimme th’ stick over there!
SPCX205*#*Ships are not build only from wood. Iron is necessary for the anchor and cannons. You never know what dangers we might encounter.
SPCX2050*#*Now I have a lump on me head an’ Olga thinks I yam some weak fella. Is that ol’ hag waving at me? I love only Olga. Have a drink with yer sailors and I’ll go tell her to leave me be.
SPCX2051*#*Ya won’t believe it! The old witch said the green stuff will give me strength like no one else. Said th’ canned kind is best. Give some of it here! I must try it.
SPCX2052*#*What da ya know. Th’ green stuff wazn’t so bad. Now let’s test me new abilities. Let’s go to th’ port and help the guys unload some heavy stuff.
SPCX2053*#*Such big rocks never seemed so light! Now I must go and pay the good ol’ lady fer givin’ me this great advice. She said the tip will cost me a lot. I hope ya can lend me some money, pal.
SPCX2054*#*That ol’ hag says she don’t want no money fer that tip, yet she still took it anywayz. I smell some trouble comin’. Maybe she hungry, let’s give her some of those fish ya caught.
SPCX2055*#*The hag abducted Olga! I saw it with me own eyes. She took her to the shack on the shore. We must take a boat to get there. I’ll show that old seawitch!
SPCX2056*#*This paddlin’ takes forever. Poor Olga must be scared. Don’t ya have somethin’ faster than this old boat? This old thing must have seen the days of me gramps Boobeye.
SPCX2057*#*This’s th’ hut of th' seawitch. Surround it with yer sailors so she can’t run away with Olga again. And now it’s time to settle things. I yam goin’ in!
SPCX2058*#*Don’t mind that black eye. She didn’t hurt me at all. I yam tougher than that. Ya have some canned spinach with ya? Could use somethin’ to eat.
SPCX2059*#*The Seawitch never had a chance! And Olga is so happy I freed her she promised to go on a date with me. I must buy her some flowers, right?
SPCX206*#*Now let’s hire some crew for the ships. We want only the best. So don’t hesitate to spend a lot of money.
SPCX2060*#*I yam just swell. Me an’ Olga are happy, Seawitch is hidin’ in her hut and leavin’ us alone. Just Bruto is skulkin’ around. I thinks he might try somethin’. I better work on those muscles of mine.
SPCX2061*#*I planned a romantic date with Olga tomorrow. I yam goin’ to take her fishin’ on a boat. I can’t risk catching nothin’. I yam still not so good at it. Can ya help, capt’n?
SPCX2062*#*Help! Throw me a paddle or somethin’. I yam not a good swimmer. Good that ya followed us. I almost drowned.
SPCX2063*#*Thank’s a lot. That scoundrel Bruto invaded our romantic fishin’ getaway. He sunk me boat an’ took Olga who knows where. Ya must help me. Find that good fer nothin’!
SPCX2064*#*No luck findin’ him yet? Poor Olga must be scared out of her mind. I must rescue her fast. That evil Bruto must have hidden her somewhere. We need more people to look fer her.
SPCX2065*#*Have ya seen Bruto before? He is a mountain of muscles. Good nutrition is important but I must work out too. Can’t let that brute defeat me. This calls fer a professional equipment.
SPCX2066*#*I am all out of spinach. The grocery at the pier has the best canned spinach I ever et. But me last job was a while ago. I have no money left. Capt’n?
SPCX2067*#*I heard that Bruto is hidin’ at Seawitch’s hut. Let’s go pay them a visit. Dis time I will break down th’ door with a rock. I yam not playing nice anymore. Not when the life of me love is at stake.
SPCX2068*#*Open the door! Someone locked me inside. Let me out, capt’n! Is there no key? You must break the door down. I would do it meself if I had some spinach. Use a ram or somethin’.
SPCX2069*#*Fuh, glad I yam out of there. It smelled like old socks inside. Let’s meet at the Rowdy House, gain some strength and plan our next move. The cook mentioned he is all out of fish. Maybe ye can help.
SPCX207*#*Our crew will need some provisions. Get us some salted fish. They should endure the long journey without getting spoiled.
SPCX2070*#*There is no more spinach. I waz in all th’ shops in town already. Not even a single can left. Let’s go to Gimpy’s farm, he is growin’ some. Yer sailors can take us there on one of yer ships, right?
SPCX2071*#*Thank spinach! Gimpy still has some left. Let’s put those green leaves into cans before they wilts. I bet Bruto is behind this treachery.
SPCX2072*#*I yam not good at searching. I will train while ye look fer Bruto. But don’t fight him, leave tha’ to meself. Just call me when ya find him. I will take care of it.
SPCX2073*#*While ye were gone, a message has arrived. They want ransom money fer Olga. I would pay them nothin’ but when I think of me girl locked in a cold cell… I don’t have a choice, right?
SPCX2074*#*I gave Bruto the money and now he wants me to give up all me spinach. I yam not goin’ to do as he says. Not anymore! Let’s prepare a trap. Load up rocks into crates and mask them as spinach cans.
SPCX2075*#*I will deliver th’ crates and ye will hide behind a wall. When Bruto comes, jump out from behind th’ wall and hit him with a stick. I and me fists will take care of th’ rest.
SPCX2076*#*I might have et too much spinach. When I hit him, Bruto flew so far away I don’t know where he ended up. We must search fer him again. Can yer sailors help?
SPCX2077*#*Didn’t find him? Maybe he fell into th’ sea and some shark et him. But how will we find Olga now? We must rescue him before th' shark is done with him. Prepare a fishnet an’ a harpoon.
SPCX2078*#*We need some bait fer th’ sharks. They must be all trying to eat Bruto somewhere far away. Can’t find even one here.
SPCX2079*#*Once Bruto tells us where he is hidin’ Olga, we can tie a barbell to him and let him sink to the bottom. Ha! But first, we must find that villain.
SPCX208*#*The first ship looks pretty good. Her name will be Concepción. Let’s find some men who will sail on her. They can also help with the construction of the second ship.
SPCX2080*#*I’ve found out what is behind the spinach shortage. Bruto is buying out all spinach in town. But it won’t work if I offer more money to th’ merchants. Ya keep searching, I yam goin’ shoppin’.
SPCX2081*#*Wonderful! We have all th’ spinach in town. Now we just need to hide it. I will dig out a hole in th’ ground and we place all th’ cans inside. Ya just put some rocks on it.
SPCX2082*#*So ya have found Bruto. Let me talk to that big buffoon. I’ll make him tell me where he’s hidin’ me sweet Olga. Ya get a ship ready. I bet he has left her on some lonely island.
SPCX2083*#*Th’ sly Seawitch helped him escape! I should have known those two are workin’ together. They are escapin’ on her magic seabroom. But they won’t escape yer sailors, right?
SPCX2084*#*There they are! Prepare th’ chains, capt’n! We won’t let ‘em go before they tell us where Olga is. Quick! They are gainin’ speed.
SPCX2085*#*Th’ evil witch has bewitched a group of sharks an’ send them after us. But their sharp teeth don’ scare me! Throw some food into th’ water to distract those sea monsters.
SPCX2086*#*No more runnin’, ya bandits! We have ya! Let’s chain them up, capt’n, and tie a barbell to their legs. They will think twice about jumpin’ into water an’ try to swim away.
SPCX2087*#*Bruto told me where he has hidden me poor Olga. Let’s go! We must save her fast. After this is over, I must take her to a dinner at th’ Rowdy House. Poor thing needs to relax a bit.
SPCX2088*#*Olga, here ya are, me love! I yam surprised Bruto left her at such a nice house. Maybe he’s not such a villain as I thought. Anyway, let’s get back to th’ town.
SPCX2089*#*Seawitch and Bruto escaped again. But Olga is safe an’ I yam not goin’ to let them take her again. I’ll build us a nice big house, where she will be safe even when I yam on the sea.
SPCX209*#*Our crew could use a place to sleep in while we finish the preparations for the voyage. Let’s build them some temporary houses. Keep it simple, they don’t need a mansion.
SPCX2090*#*There ye are, capt’n. I need yer help again. No worries, it’s nothin’ bad. I yam just plannin’ a romantic holiday with me Olga on a small island. We need someone to get us there.
SPCX2091*#*Yer sailors arre reliable as always. I yam a sailor too but I specialize in other things, ya know? I want to give them a pipe just like mine as a thank ye. Don’t ye know where I could get them?
SPCX2092*#*A break on th’ beach will do us good. Bruto and Seawitch won’t be able to find us here. But just in case, let’s place some traps around th' beach, should they send more sea monsters after us.
SPCX2093*#*Pssst. Capt’n! Listen here! Everythin’ is just perfect. We have only a small problem, Olga is hungry. There are some coconuts and bananas here but nothin’ else. Ya can brin’ us some food, right?
SPCX2094*#*He jumped out of a plane with a parachute and crashed our romantic dinner. That’s it! I will show him not to bother us again. I need ye to go to the town shop and buy all th’ spinach they have.
SPCX2095*#*Ya take care of Olga while I settle things with Bruto. An ye can prepare a stone-cold cell fer him. He is a criminal and belongs behind the bars.
SPCX2096*#*I’ll leave him fer th’ police now. He can get comfortable in his new cell. But that villain broke me favorite pipe. T’was given to me by me pa and made from some fancy wood. I must try to fix it.
SPCX2097*#*Bah, I yam no good at this handicrafts thing. These timbers are good only as kindlin’ now. Ya know where to get some good pipes, right? I will leave it to ya.
SPCX2098*#*All is good now, capt’n. We are havin’ a weddin’ with Olga. Ye can come. But ye must brin’ some fish. I still can’t catch those slippery things. I will get some spinach as dessert.
SPCX2099*#*Have fun an’ don’t forget to eat yer spinach. It’s very healthy. Lots of iron in it.
SPCX210*#*It seems we will have more seamen than expected. The salted fish you brought will not be enough. Get us a few more casks so our crew will not starve.
SPCX2100*#*So you are Bobeye’s new pal. Lookin’ for Olga, are ya? I won’t just release her because ya ask nicely. First, bring me Bobeye’s secret weapon. I don’t know yet what it is but ya must know about it.
SPCX2101*#*Ya back? What now? Are ya gonna beg me? Olga is my girl, I will not allow Bobeye to take her from me. But I might think about releasing her if ya bring me more of that green stuff.
SPCX2102*#*Ya are relentless, aren’t ya? Fine I guess I can let her go if I can gain Bobeye’s strength instead. But nothin’ happened last time I ate the spinach. Perhaps I need to gobble up more.
SPCX2103*#*She is lost again, isn’t she? Where might that girl have gone this time? Bring me more spinach and I might tell ya.
SPCX2104*#*That stupid spinach was no good. Ya must be lying. The best way to gain muscles is weight liftin’ after all. I will beat Bobeye the old-fashioned way.
SPCX2105*#*I am really tired of seeing ya. Bobeye must pay ya well to bother me all the time. Now I will pay ya to leave me alone. This is between me and Bobeye so ya better keep yer distance.
SPCX2106*#*You must be the famous captain that has been recommended to me. First, let me introduce myself. I am Thomas Andrews, a naval architect at Harland and Wolff. There is a good restaurant where we can talk.
SPCX2107*#*The Evening Star Bar is not the cheapest restaurant around but their food is excellent. I actually heard you supply them with fish. Is that true?
SPCX2108*#*I see you have many talents, captain. And that’s why I have sought you out. You see, I am working on a new ship design. It will be the 401st ship constructed by Harland and Wolff.
SPCX2109*#*We are building two ships simultaneously. I am working on Titanic which I will make even more magnificent than her sister ship. To achieve that I will need your expertise and the use of your shipping company.
SPCX211*#*One cannot live only of fish. The men will be happy to have something sweet on the long journey. So let’s stock up on this new snack- cocoa.
SPCX2110*#*Let’s go to the port and I will show you the Olympic. We have already laid down her keel. You can get a feeling of what you are getting into. Maybe take some of your sailors too.
SPCX2111*#*As you can see this task will be titanic. But don’t let that dissuade you. I am sure you can help me greatly. Now I will show you my design and you can start shipping in the materials.
SPCX2112*#*Just like her sister ship, Titanic will be propelled by screws. We will need to run some tests to determine which will work best. So don’t hesitate to bring more than a few.
SPCX2113*#*The ship was ordered by the White Star Line. They can afford an expensive vessel like this. But they will pay first after it is completed. We will need to purchase the materials with our own money.
SPCX2114*#*How is your fishing business? Will it run even without you or will you have to excuse yourself from time to time? I know that a prospering business is best taken care of directly.
SPCX2115*#*The ship will have ten decks. The inner cabins and floors will be made from wood. We are working on it at the same time while finishing up the main hull. So you can start delivering the material now.
SPCX2116*#*I have also hired a dozen stonemasons to finish the fireplaces for the first class. The size of this ship will be rivaled only by its luxury. So deliver only the highest quality marble you can find.
SPCX2117*#*A few workers have fallen out due to unexpected flu infection. I know you need your sailors for other tasks. But I promise I will borrow them only for a short time until I find some replacements.
SPCX2118*#*Titanic will operate on a route sailing through the northern Atlantic. So we need to incorporate an effective heating system. We will install pipes which will distribute hot water through the whole ship.
SPCX2119*#*In my design, I am working with three ship propellers. Two three-bladed and a center one with four blades. But you can bring in a few more just in case. We will definitely use them on our next ships.
SPCX212*#*Now it’s time to build the next two ships: Santiago and Victoria. They will be modest in size but I am sure that they will be an important part of our fleet.
SPCX2120*#*Tomorrow officials from White Star Line will come to inspect the progress on the ship. Can you take care of the refreshments? I need to prepare the models and papers.
SPCX2121*#*They were very pleased with how the works are progressing. However, their concern was mainly for the speed and luxurious equipment, not for safety. I can’t agree with that.
SPCX2122*#*I have ordered 46 lifeboats to be made. I will need you to deliver the materials. This should be enough for all of the passengers aboard.
SPCX2123*#*I have received an order to make a floor in the 1st class dining room from Italian marble. Seems a bit excessive to me. But we all have our bosses who we must listen to.
SPCX2124*#*I must go oversee the works on the upper decks. Can you send your sailors to check on the works in the lower levels? I will brief you on what to watch out for.
SPCX2125*#*It’s time we started the work on the funnels. There will be four but actually, only three are needed. The fourth will be more of an aesthetic addition. It can also serve as ventilation for the kitchens.
SPCX2126*#*The propellers you brought in last time were not good. We need bigger ones. We will surely find a use for the smaller ones too but Titanic needs screws as large as a house.
SPCX2127*#*I have been so concentrated on work I have completely forgotten to eat. I must have lost some weight because my pants are too large all of a sudden. Let’s take a break and eat something.
SPCX2128*#*We are slowly finishing the main work on the hull and deck. Time to get to the most important part - the steam engines. The engines must be made by master engineers so it won’t be cheap.
SPCX2129*#*You can start getting coal for the maiden voyage. Until the launch, it will be stored in the warehouses in the docks. Titanic has large cargo hold for fuel so bring all your fleet can manage.
SPCX213*#*We will need some harpoons to be able to restock our fish supplies on the way. There is a good blacksmith in town who can make them if you bring him the iron.
SPCX2130*#*We have forgotten the ovens for the kitchens. All the other kitchen equipment is already there. But the ladies and gentlemen of the first class won’t get satisfied with a stale bread.
SPCX2131*#*We are almost ready for launch. And after that, we can prepare for the maiden voyage. Can I ask your sailors to be a part of the crew for our first voyage? They will get paid nicely, of course.
SPCX2132*#*It’s time for the finishing touches. Fine carpets, colorful tapestries, and carved railings. We want only the best. After that Titanic will be launched. The time is set, so do not dawdle.
SPCX2133*#*There is a problem. One of the screws got chipped during the launch. We need to replace it. There is already a group of workers waiting to get it done.
SPCX2134*#*You won’t believe this! They put only 20 lifeboats on the ship. I specifically said 46. Now there is no more time to get more. Let’s hope they won’t be needed.
SPCX2135*#*Titanic will set out on her maiden voyage tomorrow. I want you to come too. There is just one more task for you before you can settle down in your luxurious cabin. Help us stock up the kitchens, captain.
SPCX2136*#*Can I bother you for a second? My valet has broken his arm and there is nobody to help him with my luggage. I won’t lie to you, the coffers are heavy like stones.
SPCX2137*#*Maybe call some friends to help too. I don’t want you to hurt yourself. The coffers are full of books, you see, so they are really heavy.
SPCX2138*#*I am Margaret but you can call me Molly. Are you a passenger too? Your captain’s outfit is wonderful but some people might confuse you with the personnel. Better buy some new clothes.
SPCX2139*#*What brings you aboard the Titanic? Business or pleasure? I am returning home to my family. My grandson has fallen ill so I want to be there for him. Come, let’s eat something and continue our talk.
SPCX214*#*Preparations for such a journey can become quite expensive. So could you pay my tab at the Fisherman’s tavern?
SPCX2140*#*Seems the delivery of the cutlery was just in time. When there is such a large project some things ought to be forgotten. I don’t mind. I grew up poor so I have no problem eating with a wooden spoon.
SPCX2141*#*I don’t think these fish are really fresh. Maybe I should have ordered meat after all. But please, tell me about yourself. I am truly interested what brings a captain aboard a ship not his own.
SPCX2142*#*So you helped build Titanic. I must say it is a magnificent ship. Maybe even the most luxurious one I have ever been aboard. If the heating stove in my room worked properly, it would be perfect.
SPCX2143*#*I would love to go on a tour of the ship. If you are too busy to walk me around, maybe your sailors could show me the ship. Meanwhile, you can check on Mr. Andrews and see if he needs your help.
SPCX2144*#*You are back, captain. I was just working on my plans for a school for destitute children. I was in Europe and Africa to see how the schools work there. I hope I can build one at home in Denver.
SPCX2145*#*Thank you for those materials. I will definitely use them for the school building. If you also want to contribute to my other cause, I am making a fundraiser for rebuilding France after the Great War.
SPCX2146*#*I do what I can to help the people in need. Sometimes, when I see this unnecessary luxury I think it’s not fair. Like the silver cutlery. If sold, hundreds of poor children could eat for years.
SPCX2147*#*It’s almost time for dinner. I hope the cook will make the fish you brought in last time. They were truly delicious. Let’s take a walk on the boat deck before we head to the dining room.
SPCX2148*#*I love the pool. A shame I have not taken my bathing suit with me. But the floor here is slippery. A railing around the pool would make it safer.
SPCX2149*#*Oh, there is even a gymnasium. I have not been here before. I am not an expert but even I can see the equipment is professional. But you are missing some barbells. I can’t believe someone would steal that.
SPCX215*#*Unfortunately our sponsor, the Spanish king doesn’t like our Portuguese crew. Even though I am Portuguese myself. We will have to exchange them for some Spaniards.
SPCX2150*#*What was that? Did we hit something? The ship stopped sharply all of a sudden. Maybe you should go to captain Smith. I will go with your sailors to check if everyone is alright.
SPCX2151*#*I overheard the officers saying that the ship is taking in water. Please, captain, go below and help with closing off the compartments. I will try to calm down the passengers.
SPCX2152*#*Have you learned anything new? Did we hit an iceberg? There was a talk about such an incident during dinner and captain Smith mentioned that it could not endanger Titanic. I only hope it’s true.
SPCX2153*#*How does it look down there? Is everything under control? Let’s try to install some feeling of normalcy and arrange a midnight snack for people who are up.
SPCX2154*#*Let’s keep the usual dining arrangement. Maybe seeing that all works as before will calm people down. However, I am so nervous I doubt I will be able to eat anything.
SPCX2155*#*Am I imagining it or is the floor suddenly askew? I think it’s time we made our way to the lifeboats. Let’s take the people we meet with us.
SPCX2156*#*The panic has already broken out. We need to calm people down before they trample the unlucky ones who fall on the floor. Your sailors could try to keep the panic from spreading too.
SPCX2157*#*We need to talk to someone in charge and find out what is happening. But there are just too many people here. I can’t get any further like this. Captain, can you find a way out?
SPCX2158*#*The women and children in lower classes can’t get to the lifeboats. The officers are keeping the gates between the decks closed. Maybe if we give them some money, they will let them go.
SPCX2159*#*So there is not enough lifeboats for everyone. And the ship is getting even more askew. They won’t be able to lower the boats on the water. Could we move some heavy cargo to balance the ship?
SPCX216*#*Four ships are finished. Now we need only the main vessel. It will be the flagship of our fleet and will be called Trinidad. I will command her myself.
SPCX2160*#*People are going crazy. Someone has stabbed a woman with a silver kitchen knife to get into a lifeboat. We need to get the sharp items out of the way before someone else gets hurt.
SPCX2161*#*Not everyone can be saved. I will gladly give up my place in one of the lifeboats. But the poor souls who can’t be saved should at least have their last moments bearable and have some food and drink.
SPCX2162*#*This is crazy. People are jumping into the water to try to get into the lifeboats. One was already turned over. Can’t we make some prams out of the wooden furniture?
SPCX2163*#*Let’s get to the boat deck! We should help keep the people under control. Everyone is trying to get to the lifeboats and the officers have trouble lowering them safely down. The pulley needs strengthening too.
SPCX2164*#*No, no! I don’t want to get on a boat! Take a child instead! I don’t mind staying here. Captain, save as many as you can!
SPCX2165*#*It’s so good to see you survived too. Help me. We must get the people from the freezing water into the boats. There is still free space here. Look! There is a ship coming this way.
SPCX2166*#*I am captain Rostron of the ship Carpathia. We intercepted a distress call from Titanic and we came as fast as we could. Please tell me, what happened here? Where is the ship?
SPCX2167*#*We must make haste. Bring the people from the lifeboats aboard Carpathia. And the ones still in water need lifebuoys until we get to them.
SPCX2168*#*Take the lifeboats from my ship and go save as many people from the water as you can. Let’s hope there are still some alive.
SPCX2169*#*The survivors need warm blankets and some nutritious food. Please take care of them. My men and I will continue in the search for survivors.
SPCX217*#*We are nearing the time of departure. I know I will be gone a long time so I want to know my wife and child are taken care of. The first thing they need is a safe home.
SPCX2170*#*We hurried to get here as fast as possible so we used all fuel for speed and turned off the heating. If there is something that we might use to heat up the stoves, use it. The survivors need warmth now.
SPCX2171*#*There are some people clinging to debris in the water near the iceberg south-west from here. Will you go there and save them? I must stay on the ship and lead the rescue operations.
SPCX2172*#*We need to maneuver very carefully here. There are many icebergs in this area. We might have to get rid of some cargo to lighten the ship.
SPCX2173*#*The people we saved have lost everything they had with them. They will need some money for food and to get home once we arrive in New York.
SPCX2174*#*We can’t risk another tragedy. With so many icebergs here we should be ready for anything. Let’s give out the lifebuoys to all people aboard.
SPCX2175*#*We could heat up the cabins by collecting some wooden debris from the water and burning it. We have barely enough fuel to get back to New York now. We can’t use it for heating.
SPCX2176*#*One of the survivors, Mrs. Brown is her name, is greatly helping all the others. See if you can assist her in any way. Maybe she needs some medical supplies or food for the people.
SPCX2177*#*Mrs. Brown would like to cook some hot food for the survivors. There should be pans and pots in the kitchen. We can spare a bit of wood for the cooking. Will you prepare the kitchen for her?
SPCX2178*#*My men have been searching the water for an hour without finding any more survivors. I think it’s time we set the course for New York. Search the debris one last time and then we leave.
SPCX2179*#*The voyage to New York will take a few days. There is a free bunk for you in the crew's quarters. After you rest, you could help Mrs. Brown with planning a fundraiser for the victims of the catastrophe.
SPCX218*#*Good, the house should be comfortable enough. Now they only need some money for the food and other items for my little son. Having a child can be quite expensive.
SPCX2180*#*We are almost in the city. I won’t be able to stay for long. I must continue the planned voyage. But I trust you will assist the survivors. Help them find a temporary home until their families come for them.
SPCX2181*#*We are here. Please help me collect the lifebuoys from the passengers. We will need them on our next voyage too. Then we can disembark.
SPCX2182*#*There is no free landing dock large enough for the Carpathia. We will need to send the people to the pier on boats. Can you prepare them?
SPCX2183*#*The boats are ready so let’s start transporting people to the pier. I will stay aboard and arrive with the last passengers. You go now. I will see you at the pier soon.
SPCX2184*#*Everyone is safely ashore. I must resupply and continue the scheduled voyage. We have given out most of our food to the survivors so we need more supplies first.
SPCX2185*#*I must sail out now. I am glad we could save so many people together. And please take care captain. The icebergs are no joke. Make sure all your ships sailing in icy waters are properly reinforced.
SPCX2186*#*My name is Margaret Hardenbroeck. I am a merchant from New Amsterdam and I could use your help. Please, finish whatever business you have and then we can talk.
SPCX2187*#*Maybe you expected to talk with a man, that I am only an assistant. But no. I am the owner of the Hardenbroeck trading business. I hope you have no problem with that and that we can start our business.
SPCX2188*#*Good, I am glad that you are ready to work with me. I am running trading voyages back to Holland with my small fleet. However, the ships can’t take all the cargo I buy anymore.
SPCX2189*#*I will also need to hire your sailors to sail the ships. I hope that won’t be a problem. I can pay for the ships and the men both. And you can accompany me on my voyages if you wish to.
SPCX219*#*Children love sweets. I know it is not very healthy but I want my child to think of me well while I am gone. I trust my wife to not give him too much of them.
SPCX2190*#*I believe that a beneficial cooperation requires mutual trust. So let us get to know each other a bit. How about a dinner? Would you prefer your place or mine?
SPCX2191*#*It’s nice to see you still have time for home-cooking. I am too busy taking care of the business to cook. These fish are truly tasty. A pity you don’t have a matching wine to go with it.
SPCX2192*#*In this age, it’s hard for women to be independent. But not so in Holland. I can own a business myself. It’s only trouble when I have to deal with the Englishmen. Last time we argued about a shipment of iron.
SPCX2193*#*I have a husband and five kids. Sometimes it’s hard to make time for them but I am doing my best. Actually, we are going to the fair tomorrow. You can join us if you would like.
SPCX2194*#*Let’s talk business. Before we go on our first trading voyage we must build a new warehouse. We need a safe and dry place to store the goods. Our old warehouse has a bad roof and it is too small anyway.
SPCX2195*#*Now let’s go have a look at my fleet. I want you to tell me what you think. I am a merchant, not a captain or a shipwright. So be honest, are my ships any good?
SPCX2196*#*We will make the adjustments as you suggested. After a little rebuilding, we can expand the cargo hold on each ship. Now let’s talk to my crew. They are good men, even if some of them are missing experience.
SPCX2197*#*Before a voyage, I always invite my crew for a meal at the tavern in the port. Helps build the good relations among us. How about we continue this tradition with you and your men?
SPCX2198*#*Now let’s get ready for the voyage. I like to go and sell the goods in Holland myself. I know the business best. We will take some pelts and cloth, and sell it in Europe. Then buy some local products.
SPCX2199*#*The cargo is loaded. I will send for my luggage and we can sail out. If there is something you wish to trade in Europe too now is to time to load it up.
SPCX220*#*It is time we set sail. I hope you are ready because we won’t be coming back for a long time. Let’s get the last of my crew and set off.
SPCX2200*#*Ah, I just love the Netherlands. I really like it in America but I miss my home sometimes. I am going to negotiate the trade and you just make the crates with goods ready for unloading.
SPCX2201*#*I found the perfect olive oil from Spain for a good price. There is a high demand for it in New Amsterdam. But I did not manage to sell all our goods yet. I would be grateful if you could lend me a small sum.
SPCX2202*#*I did not manage to sell all our goods. We will have to store them in our family warehouse in the city. It is a bit run down, so we might have to fix it up a bit before we use it.
SPCX2203*#*Our ships are filled with oils, pins, and pans. We are ready to head back. I hope your sailors are waiting for us at the docks. My men sometimes forget themselves at the portside tavern.
SPCX2204*#*Before I forget, I must get something for my kids. I always bring them the chocolates from Belgium. They can make the best chocolate there. Usually, I take some for myself too.
SPCX2205*#*Do you see those ships in the New Amsterdam harbor? That fleet is flying the British flag. Send one of your ships ahead and find out what is going on. Pretend you are a fisherman, just to be on the safe side.
SPCX2206*#*So the British have taken over New Amsterdam. I wonder what this will mean for me and my family. You have to claim to be the owner of these goods, captain. They won't accept a female merchant.
SPCX2207*#*Let’s hurry to the city. I must go to my family and make sure they are safe. Please take care of the ships and cargo. Just take it all to the warehouses. I will return as fast as I can.
SPCX2208*#*I will have to make some changes. I can’t own or buy any property from now on, not even my own business. We will have to go to the notary and change the owner to my husband.
SPCX2209*#*They even changed the name of the city. I would return to Holland but everything I have is here now. So we will have to adjust. First, let’s build a wall around my house. It will make me feel safer.
SPCX221*#*I have forgotten about the weapons! How will we face danger out there without them? Quick, get some before we leave for the open sea!
SPCX2210*#*I decided to buy a new ship. Of course, in my husband's name but I will do the choosing and I will sail with her too. Let’s go to the port and call your sailors too to help us with the selection.
SPCX2211*#*King Charles is a fine name for my new ship. Let’s show the Englishmen that a woman can trade on an English ship too. I also want to buy some seafood since we are already at the pier.
SPCX2212*#*The ship is pretty expensive. Do we still have some of that French wine we bought in Europe? We might get a better price if we give the seller a little gift.
SPCX2213*#*That worked out well. Now let’s go inspect my new ship. I think the anchor looked a bit rusty but otherwise, she should be in a good shape.
SPCX2214*#*Good, everything is ready for the next voyage. I have already enough pelts in my warehouses to fill all the ships. We just need some containers to keep them dry and clean.
SPCX2215*#*At least here I am still a rightful merchant of my own, not just a secretary to my husband. I don’t need you to go negotiate with me. Do your own business in the city, I know you have some things to sell.
SPCX2216*#*This time, we managed to sell all the pelts we brought. Now it’s time to fill our ships with a new cargo. Let’s go to the market and choose some fine products.
SPCX2217*#*I don’t feel so good, captain. Maybe I caught a cold on the ship. Please make sure all the cargo gets loaded on ships. I must lay down for a while.
SPCX2218*#*I see you managed to load up everything. Now we are only missing some food for the way back. And then we can head home, I can’t wait to be back in my warm bed with my kids around me.
SPCX2219*#*I have purchased some fine silk cloth at the market. But the seller did not have all of it in the stall. Could you go to his shop and get it? I will wait for you on the ship.
SPCX222*#*It seems we have everything. The weather is nice and the sea is calm. This is a good start to a successful expedition.
SPCX2220*#*This sickness made me realize that I need to start thinking about my successors. I also saw these wonderful pans on the market. I think I would like to spend more time at home cooking.
SPCX2221*#*One of my older ships is starting to fall apart. You are good with ships, captain, have a look at her. Maybe she can be fixed. If not, I will have to sell her for scrap.
SPCX2222*#*My daughters are slowly coming to the age to be wed. They grow up so fast. It is time to start saving up for their dowry. I will help them find husbands worthy of them.
SPCX2223*#*I was lucky to have had the chance to be an independent merchant. My daughters will have it much more difficult. But I will help them as much as I can. I will build a house for each one.
SPCX2224*#*I think about my sons too. They will inherit my business from me. They already know the basics but now is the time they had a taste of the sailor’s life too. Our crew could give them a few lessons.
SPCX2225*#*It’s not easy for a woman to take care of family and business both. But we are strong, captain, so never underestimate us. Let’s hope there will come a time when everyone understands it.
SPCX2226*#*The capital of Northern Ireland is the place where we will build the most magnificent ship in history. Now let’s start piling up some materials!
SPCX2227*#*This will be the largest ship in the world once we launch her. Titanic will be almost 270 m long with a displacement of 52,310 tons. So make those ship screws you deliver really huge.
SPCX2228*#*Such a large ship needs a lot of power to get moving. The three engines will take care of it. Two reciprocating steam engines and one  Parsons turbine. Each will be driving a propeller.
SPCX2229*#*The engines will be powered by steam which will be created in the boilers by heating up water. I am counting with a consumption of 600 tons of coal a day to maintain the optimal speed.
SPCX223*#*Alas! The fish you have delivered in the last shipment were not preserved correctly. They have gone foul. Can you get us some more supplies?
SPCX2230*#*Lest I forget we need two more steering steam-engines to move the rudder. It will be huge just like the ship with a weight of more than a 100 tons. It would be impossible to move by hand.
SPCX2231*#*Passengers can board Titanic in three ports. In Southampton from where we start the maiden voyage, in Cherbourg in France, and in Queenstown. Let’s make sure the passengers will have all the comfort they need.
SPCX2232*#*The first class passengers will be able to use the swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, and a Turkish bath. If you have the money, Titanic will be your luxurious floating hotel.
SPCX2233*#*If you are hungry, just choose a place to enjoy a delectable meal either at the À la Carte Restaurant led by a famous Italian chef, the Café Parisien, or the Verandah Café.
SPCX2234*#*Have you seen the Grand Staircase yet? It’s the most beautiful part of the ship. It is built of solid oak, descending through seven decks of the ship, and capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass.
SPCX2235*#*We did not sell all the tickets for Titanic's maiden voyage. The full capacity is 2,453 passengers, 833 in First Class, 614 in Second Class, and 1,006 in the Third Class. Still, we will need a lot of cutlery.
SPCX2236*#*Mr. Morgan has asked for a private cabin on the Titanic. He is the owner of the White Star Line and a really big fish. Let’s make sure he has nothing to complain about.
SPCX2237*#*Titanic will have three propellers and three anchors. Such a large ship needs at least three to anchor safely. I will take care of the anchors and you make sure everything is nice and shiny.
SPCX2238*#*During a large construction such as this mishaps ought to happen. But I worry the eight dead workers are a bad omen for the ship. Maybe I am just superstitious. But silver should ward off evil, right?
SPCX2239*#*There is various entertainment for the passengers. We will even have our own daily newspaper, the Atlantic Daily Bulletin. It will feature the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.
SPCX224*#*There are dark clouds in the distance, a storm is coming. I hope it won’t be too violent. But just in case bring us some wood for ship repairs.
SPCX2240*#*The national coal strike has caused us some difficulties. We had to get coal for the maiden voyage from other ships in Southampton. We almost had to postpone the voyage.
SPCX2241*#*Did you know Titanic’s homeport is registered as Liverpool? There are the offices of the White Star Line. Come, I will tell you more during dinner.
SPCX2242*#*Fun fact, captain. We needed 22 tons of soap and tallow to lubricate the slipway during Titanic’s launching into the River Lagan. We sure made her clean.
SPCX2243*#*Titanic and her sister ship Olympic will have the main competition in the Cunard Line’s Mauretania and Lusitania. We will not let them beat us in speed, size, or comfort.
SPCX2244*#*In the end, we have only 20 lifeboats on Titanic. There are 14 standard wooden boats, four Englehardt "collapsible" lifeboats, and two emergency cutters. We will need to take more lifebuoys at least.
SPCX2245*#*I received the numbers of tickets we sold for Titanic’s maiden voyage. We will have 1,317 passengers: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Make sure there is a lifebuoy for everyone.
SPCX2246*#*If all goes well, Titanic should arrive at New York Pier 59 on the morning of 17 April. Foul weather could delay us a bit, I can’t imagine what else. But take some more lifebuoys so the passengers feel safe.
SPCX2247*#*We have a bit of a problem. There is a fire burning in one of the coal bunkers. We could not extinguish it for several days now. But let’s keep it to ourselves. No use in worrying the passengers.
SPCX2248*#*Titanic will be captained by Edward Smith. He is a good captain with a lot of experience on the liners of the White Star Line. I know him personally, he is a bit old-fashioned but reliable.
SPCX2249*#*We won’t have a permanent professional crew. I have voiced my concerns about this but the company prefers to hire crew from the casual workers. I made sure that at least a few members are real sailors.
SPCX225*#*We have reached the land before the storm caught us. However I can see it wrought havoc in this little port. Let’s help the poor people rebuild their town.
SPCX2250*#*There are 885 crew members on Titanic. Help me make sure they know at least the basics of safety measures on ships.
SPCX2251*#*However, most of our crew are not seamen at all. We need a lot of people servicing the engine rooms and stewards taking care of the passengers. These people know only a little about sailing.
SPCX2252*#*Titanic is equipped to carry 3,339 passengers and crew. We won’t be full for the maiden voyage but we should have some lifebuoys in reserve.
SPCX2253*#*Do you have some ink, friend? I just used up the last drop of mine. I need it quickly before I forget that great twist in the story.
SPCX2254*#*There… it’s all down black on white. I apologize, I have not even introduced myself. I am Jules Verne, a writer. I just wanted to go to the shop but I lost my money. And then I got this great idea.
SPCX2255*#*Let me invite you for a glass of wine to show you my gratitude. You don’t drink on empty stomach? I am sure we can get some fish here since we are near the port.
SPCX2256*#*Welcome to my humble house. I love writing but it does not pay nearly as much as I need. So what do you do? I have noticed a bunch of muscular guys waiting for you outside. Just invite them in, I don’t mind.
SPCX2257*#*So you are a captain and these muscular guys are your sailors? You had me worried there for a bit that I got involved with a mafia boss. I may not have enough chairs for all of you.
SPCX2258*#*So what exactly do you do, captain? Are you an explorer, a merchant, or perhaps a pirate? Either way, I know you have some great stories to tell. What cargo have you brought to Nantes, do tell?
SPCX2259*#*You have some interesting life. I could use your experiences for my stories. How about you tell me some exciting things and I will make sure your business flourishes here in France.
SPCX226*#*We already used up most of our supplies. The merchant in town will help us resupply our ships. But we need more gold, everything is terribly expensive here.
SPCX2260*#*If you want to earn a lot of gold or other materials, get involved in the building of the railway to Paris. It’s where the money is right now and they need tons of iron.
SPCX2261*#*While you were tending to your business, I read the newspaper. They just opened the Suez Canal. Did you hear? That’s great news for you too. It will make sailing to Asia so much faster.
SPCX2262*#*How goes the business? Do you have a deal with the guys from the railway? I bet you could earn a nice sum by delivering food to the workers too.
SPCX2263*#*The opening of the Suez Canal and other new travel possibilities should make it possible to finish a trip around the world in a short time. I will need your sailors experience concerning the details.
SPCX2264*#*I get so excited when I get a new idea for a story. Come, let’s discuss how you would travel around the world. Maybe you can make a few test voyages with some cargo so it will be profitable for you too.
SPCX2265*#*How did the voyage go? How much time did you need to travel through the Suez Canal? Ah, I am all out of ink again! I would buy a whole barrel of it if I only had some more money.
SPCX2266*#*I have had some difficulties while you were gone. I have been enlisted as a coast guard during the time of war. But I will still work on my story. I just need a table and a chair to continue my work.
SPCX2267*#*The heroes of my story would need to travel mostly on steamships. Those are the fastest vessels. Do you have any in your fleet? Maybe you could show them to me.
SPCX2268*#*These steamers are magnificent ships. You must have a lot of money to afford a fleet such as this. I have not received royalties for my books for a few months now. The war is not good for the economy.
SPCX2269*#*I will give it all back once I get paid again. These are not good times for writers. So let’s just concentrate on something more pleasant for now like the voyage around the world.
SPCX227*#*The land in the distance is the coast of the New World. We need to turn south now. If we meet any natives a generous gift of cocoa will surely appease them.
SPCX2270*#*I must learn to catch fish to save some money. Food in France was never cheap but with the war going on it’s even more expensive. I am thinking about buying a small boat to use for fishing and relaxing.
SPCX2271*#*This guard tower is so old I fear the roof will fall on me without the enemy ever getting in sight. I would be grateful if someone could do at least the basic repairs.
SPCX2272*#*I have been counting how long it would take to travel around the world. Do you think 60 days are enough? Probably not. I will have to do some revisions. And again I have used up all my ink.
SPCX2273*#*At last, the war is over, I can return home and finish my book in peace. My wife is with her family on their estate in a small shore village. We could use one of your ships to bring her home.
SPCX2274*#*The house is fine. Luckily, only the fence got torn down. I could not afford any larger repairs. Let’s hope that with the war over I will get my royalties paid now.
SPCX2275*#*My mother came from a family of shipowners and working with you has reminded me of the pleasures of sailing. Once I get paid I will invest in a small ship. But maybe you could lend me some money in advance.
SPCX2276*#*It’s been a long time since I last sailed on a boat. My mum used to take me aboard when I was just a boy. Could your sailors show me how to sail my new beauty, the Saint-Michel?
SPCX2277*#*I have this dream to sail around Europe one day. To experience an adventure just like those I write about. But it will have to be a larger boat than this. But she is just perfect for a short fishing trip.
SPCX2278*#*I have neglected my writing. Mr. Fogg and his valet have almost finished their voyage. Now I just have to come up with an interesting  ending. Meanwhile, you can take care of your shipping business.
SPCX2279*#*My boat Saint-Michel is moored at the city harbor but I would like her closer to my house. I own a bit of shore attached to my land. There we could build a small wooden pier.
SPCX228*#*We should look for a place where to wait out the bad winter weather. Get us some materials to construct the houses in which we will overwinter.
SPCX2280*#*I have good news. I just got paid royalties for my published book. I will pay you back all I owe you. I just can’t go to the shop right now and buy ink. I need to continue my writing while the ideas are coming.
SPCX2281*#*Our heroes made it. They finished the voyage around the world in 80 days. And I finished the book. There is nothing quite like the feeling of a work well done.
SPCX2282*#*I hope someone will one day prove that a voyage as I described is possible. Maybe it will even be you and your sailors. I would be truly honored. Let me say farewell to all of you.
SPCX2283*#*You might know me by my pen name, Nellie Bly. I write for the New York World. If you have not read my book, Ten Days in a Madhouse, I recommend you buy it. But that’s not what I wanted to talk about.
SPCX2284*#*I am a journalist but I don’t write about fashion or gardening. I am interested in more exciting stories. Like those from Jules Verne. He is such a great writer he would deserve his own statue.
SPCX2285*#*I want to recreate the voyage around the world. As his friend, you must know his works well. Will you help me? I promise I will make you the best dinner you ever had if you do. Just tell me what you’d like.
SPCX2286*#*So you will help me. I am so glad! Together we will make the fantasy a reality. Let’s meet tomorrow at 7 in the morning. We will plan everything. But be sure to come on time. I must be at work at 8.
SPCX2287*#*I have already spoken to my boss at the newspaper. He was excited about the idea. This will be a frontpage story for sure. Now I must go to the tailor and have a dress made which will endure the travel.
SPCX2288*#*The dress is made from a nice sturdy material which won’t get torn easily. But it is a bit loose at the waist. Do you have some pins so I can mark where I need to get it trimmed?
SPCX2289*#*I have already checked the timetable for ships leaving New York. I would love to use one of your ships but that would make the voyage too easy. But you could prepare one ship to accompany us on the voyage.
SPCX229*#*Would you believe it?! Some of my men have organized a mutiny. They want to return to Spain with 3 of my ships. But I have a plan already. Quick, bring me some weapons!
SPCX2290*#*You will have to leave the business in the hands of your crew. I hope you can trust them, we will be gone for some time. Make the arrangements with them and I am going to pack my things.
SPCX2291*#*Pack lightly, we want to be able to move fast. I am taking only a small bag with me. You don’t want to drag around heavy baggage. Leave all that here. I promise no one will touch your things.
SPCX2292*#*We need to take a good reliable watch. We can't afford to miss the ships and trains if we want to finish the voyage under 80 days.
SPCX2293*#*Now let’s fill our bellies with something tasty before we start our journey. Who knows when we will be able to get something to eat again.
SPCX2294*#*The steamer which will take us across the ocean is the Augusta Victoria. And we are late! Quickly, she is already leaving port! Do you have a boat at hand? We might still catch her.
SPCX2295*#*This ship is seriously understaffed. I don’t know how they could leave the port like this. Will we even be able to reach our destination on time? We can’t afford to miss the next ship.
SPCX2296*#*Are we in London already? I will send a telegram from the main post office to my boss. He wants to be informed about each step of our journey. Meanwhile, you can buy tickets for the train to Brindisi.
SPCX2297*#*You’ve got the tickets? Great! I just got a message that Mr. Verne would like to meet us in France. If we hurry, we can make it. God! It’s freezing here. I hope there are some heaters in the train.
SPCX2298*#*We must board a ship heading for the continent before we can board the train. But first I need to sleep a little. It was impossible to do on the ship. I am so tired I could sleep on rocks.
SPCX2299*#*I feel so much better after a few hours of rest. Now let’s have a taste of the famous English fish and chips and then we can continue our voyage. I can’t wait to meet Mr. Verne.
SPCX230*#*Of course they did not succeed with their foolish riot. The fate of these three captains should be a warning for everyone else. All the ships are safe and we can continue.
SPCX2300*#*I am so clumsy! My pocket watch fell into the water as I was getting aboard the ship. And it was my favorite too.
SPCX2301*#*These bunks on the ships are awfully uncomfortable. At least I slept a bit ashore. My soft bed at home is what I miss the most right now.
SPCX2302*#*Paris is as beautiful as I heard. Unfortunately, I feel my allergies are starting to show. And I did not take my medicine with me. Could you send some of your men for it back to New York? I really need it.
SPCX2303*#*We don’t have much time to see Paris. We must catch the train to Amiens where we will meet Mr. and Mrs. Verne. Do you see a cart for luggage somewhere? I think you did bring too much stuff.
SPCX2304*#*I would love to have a signed copy of one of Mr. Verne’s novels. But of course, I did not take any of his books with me. If I had any time to spare, I would buy one.
SPCX2305*#*Do you speak French? I don’t think Mr. Verne is fluent in English. There they are! They are waiting for us at the station. Come, and don’t forget your luggage in the train!
SPCX2306*#*Mr. and Mrs. Verne have a really nice house. The garden is beautiful too. There are just a few fish missing in the pond and it would be the perfect French villa. I could stay here forever.
SPCX2307*#*Mrs. Verne prepared a lunch for us! I am starving. I feel a bit ashamed I had not brought some gift for them. Do you have something appropriate on you?
SPCX2308*#*If we are to finish our journey on time, we must get back on the road. But I fear this carriage will get us only to the next ditch by the road. Don’t we have something better than this old decrepit thing?
SPCX2309*#*Can we go any faster? I am afraid the train will leave without us. Can you do something? Maybe your sailors could delay the train so we manage to get aboard.
SPCX231*#*My faithful crew deserves a nice dinner so they know how much I cherish their loyalty. Help me with the food because my loyal men deserve something fresh.
SPCX2310*#*I am going to get some sleep. Wake me when we arrive in Brindisi. I heard there is the owner of the railways aboard. You might want to have a chat with him. He is looking for a supplier of iron.
SPCX2311*#*I know we don’t have much time here before we must board the ship to Asia but I love Italian food. Let’s get some pasta at the nearest trattoria. Do you have any Italian money?
SPCX2312*#*The English liner Victoria will take us to Colombo. You will find her already moored at the pier. The crew is loading up a cargo of marble. There is a lot of it, they might need help transporting it.
SPCX2313*#*How did you sleep? I was woken up too many times by the steward and the bed was awfully hard. And now I found out we missed the breakfast too. This will be a hard day.
SPCX2314*#*We will have a few days rest in Colombo before we need to board the next ship. I am looking forward to spending some time on land. I am going to send a message to New York. Can you take our bags?
SPCX2315*#*I mentioned to the captain of Victoria that the beds were of poor quality. Perhaps you could help him find ones that would be more comfortable. I will go ahead to our hotel. We can meet there later.
SPCX2316*#*Ceylon looks like a lush green garden. A beautiful place. I am glad we will have some time to look around. Are any of your sailors here by any chance? I would love to rent a boat and sail around the island.
SPCX2317*#*This is the first country where the merchants are eager to get their hands on American Dollars. I am glad I took some with me. There are some fine silks at the market which I would like to take home.
SPCX2318*#*It’s time we continued our voyage. The steamer Oriental will take us to China. Let’s take a few cans of tea as a souvenir. I heard that the iron cans can keep the tea fresh for the longest time.
SPCX2319*#*This hurricane is truly terrifying.  And almost everyone on the ship got seasick. Even the cook. Now we don’t have anything to eat. I don’t want to go down with an empty stomach.
SPCX232*#*After the mutiny I don’t have enough men for all the ships. Let’s try to recruit some from the village nearby.
SPCX2320*#*Thankfully, we got out of that hurricane unscathed. And I can already see Hong Kong in the distance. If you still have some of that Italian marble, you can sell it here for a good price.
SPCX2321*#*I know I always leave the bags to you. But the hurricane left me truly exhausted this time. I promise I will take them next time myself.
SPCX2322*#*It’s Christmas Eve tomorrow. I was thinking about making a short trip to Canton to see a real Chinese city. And later we could make a small Christmas celebration with a tree and everything.
SPCX2323*#*Can you believe it? Someone stole my purse. On Christmas! I don’t think this is my favorite part of the world. I hope you still have some money or else we won’t be able to finish this voyage.
SPCX2324*#*Now we can continue our voyage on the Oceanic. I heard there was a flu infection among the crew and they will be hiring new sailors in Hong Kong. Maybe some of your men could apply.
SPCX2325*#*China was fascinating but I can’t wait to see Japan. Our next stop will be in Yokohama. We are a bit behind schedule. Let’s go talk to the captain and see if we can do something to speed up the voyage.
SPCX2326*#*I have been contacted by a reporter from Tokyo. He wants to interview me about my voyage. I will meet with him for dinner. I hope you won’t get hungry here alone.
SPCX2327*#*The reporter told me about an enormous statue of Buddha near Tokyo. We should go see it. It was damaged during a hurricane so it may not be standing for long now. It’s a pity, it's supposed to be really old.
SPCX2328*#*I love it here. Everything is nice and clean, the people are polite and smiling. I have already bought some wooden samurai statues to remind me of Japan at home. Can you take them aboard the ship?
SPCX2329*#*It’s time to say sayonara and board the Oceanic once again. It will take us across the Pacific. And from there it is just a long train ride home. Let’s make sure we did not forget anything here.
SPCX233*#*The village has experienced a flood not so long ago. They are rebuilding their houses now. If we help them, more men might offer to come with us.
SPCX2330*#*We must undergo a health exam before they let us go ashore in Los Angeles. I hope you are feeling well. We are so close to finishing this voyage. Then we must hurry to the train station to buy the tickets.
SPCX2331*#*I am so tired. I will go lay down in our sleeper wagon and I hope when I wake up, we will be in New York. I just need to find a working heater. It’s freezing in here.
SPCX2332*#*I am so happy. Not because I have gone around the world in seventy-two days, but because I am home again. I want to thank you and everyone that has helped me on this journey.
SPCX2333*#*Where did I put it? Where could it only be? Oh, I am sorry! Did I bump into you? I am just looking for my hat. Nevermind, I will just buy a new one. But wait, where is my purse?
SPCX2334*#*I was a bit distracted. Do you see those birds on the railing? I have not seen them here in this time of the year before. Fascinating! Please tell your employees not to scare them away.
SPCX2335*#*Now I will just make a few notes about this exciting observation and I won’t bother you anymore. Please, just go back to your business.
SPCX2336*#*It seems I will have to impose on you some more. The captain of my ship has unexpectedly fallen ill. You were recommended as his replacement. Let’s just find an empty bench and have a chat.
SPCX2337*#*The ship HMS Beagle is already waiting in port ready to sail out. Wait... I will be with you in a second. I just need to find my geology toolkit. These tools are priceless for me.
SPCX2338*#*So where was I... We will be sailing on a survey voyage on the HMS Beagle mapping the coast of South America and other places. We will be carrying some special equipment, I will help you with that.
SPCX2339*#*Captain FitzRoy promised to join us for lunch if his health allows it. He will fill you in on the details. I am just a naturalist here to observe the nature and collect samples for further research.
SPCX234*#*The houses are repaired and we have a full crew again. But now that we have more men we will also need more food. Refilling our supplies is in order.
SPCX2340*#*I hope all your questions were answered by captain FitzRoy. He has already hired a crew but if you wish to take your sailors instead, I am sure he would not object.
SPCX2341*#*Let’s go to the market and buy the food supplies for the voyage, salted meat, grains, fresh water. I will join you if you don’t mind. The preparations for the voyage are so exciting!
SPCX2342*#*The time to start the voyage is here. Unfortunately, I received word that the fitting out of the ship is not finished yet. Maybe we could help speed up the work somehow.
SPCX2343*#*The ship is ready yet the strong western winds are still keeping us moored in the port. We must wait here anyway, so I can show you some of my work. Let’s go to a dig site I have been working on.
SPCX2344*#*I had to convince my father to sponsor my participation on the voyage. Once I return, I plan on taking him to the dig site. I will give him some tools at Christmas so we can work together.
SPCX2345*#*The winds have calmed down. I think we can set sails. What do you say, captain? Alas, I think our lightning conductor has rusted in the foul England weather. Let’s replace it fast so we can head out.
SPCX2346*#*There is nothing quite like the feeling of standing on the prow of the ship when she sails onwards. But it seems to me too few of your sailors are on deck. Are they still sleeping off Christmas celebration?
SPCX2347*#*I have constructed a plankton net to be towed behind the ship. I am curious what kinds of creatures are living on the open sea. We might even catch us some dinner with it.
SPCX2348*#*Truly fascinating! There are so many kinds of water creatures living here. I would never have guessed. Come, take a look! I will just have to store them in some boxes and research them closely at home.
SPCX2349*#*We have arrived at our first stop, the Canary Islands. But I have bad news. They won’t let us disembark due to the cholera outbreak in England. I have at least requested some supplies to be delivered.
SPCX235*#*The terrain ahead looks perilous. I will send out two ships to scout the way ahead. Bring us some wood in the meantime so we can make repairs on the remaining ships.
SPCX2350*#*The next stop will be on the Cape Verde Islands. I hope this time we will be able to get on land so I can collect some geological samples.
SPCX2351*#*We will set up a survey station on this smaller island. I can collect sea animals from the tide pools and look for more interesting samples inland. Where did I put the toolkit again?
SPCX2352*#*Have you already set up the survey station? Come, bring the equipment from the ship and I will help you with the installation. There is a good place at the top of this hill.
SPCX2353*#*I have collected some interesting animals on the shore. Come look at this amazing octopus. It changes colors like a chameleon. There are also many different kinds of fish I never saw before.
SPCX2354*#*Are we already done with all the necessary measurements? Good. Then let’s send the men to collect the equipment and we can move on. More fascinating things await us.
SPCX2355*#*Now we are heading for the coast of Brazil. I have noticed we are running low on fresh water. Let’s prepare the empty barrels so we can have them filled once we arrive in the city of Salvador.
SPCX2356*#*There are some measurements needed off the shore which may take a month or two. While you go and take care of that, I would like to stay in the city. I will rent a house here and concentrate on my research.
SPCX2357*#*You are back already! There are some wonderfully preserved fossils I excavated outside the city. I will show them to you once we are on the ship. But now help me carry my tools aboard.
SPCX2358*#*I had not enough time to excavate all the fossils. I need you to take some of the larger rocks aboard too. I will work on them while we sail along the coast. This is really important for science, trust me.
SPCX2359*#*Have you heard of Patagonia? That land is a treasure trove for a geologist like me. I will find local guides to help me travel there. Are you interested in joining us? Then take some food and let’s go.
SPCX236*#*One of the ships has deserted and set course back to Spain. Let’s try to catch up to them. I will pay you nicely if you help me in this chase.
SPCX2360*#*Have you seen how the Gauchos caught that ostrich? Fascinating! Let’s try that too. Give me some iron cord and we can try making a trap like that too.
SPCX2361*#*Look at this skull! It must have been some animal related to the rhino. There must be the whole skeleton buried nearby. But without some help, we will be digging here for a month searching for it.
SPCX2362*#*With the help of your men we had it excavated in no time. And now that I see the whole skeleton this does not seem like a rhino. Let’s pack it into boxes and carry it to the ship.
SPCX2363*#*Oh, I forgot to pay the Gaucho guides. They are looking somewhat angry. Can you pay them? I wouldn’t risk them trying their hunting skills on us.
SPCX2364*#*Oh no! I have left my toolkit in the desert where we excavated the skeleton. I will never get such fine tools again. This was the perfect set chosen from among thousands of others.
SPCX2365*#*Our guides want to express their gratitude by sharing one last meal with us. This is a grilled armadillo. Have a taste and then bring some fish we can put on the grill. Some things are not meant to be eaten.
SPCX2366*#*Our next stop will be at the southern tip of South America. Tierra del Fuego is the homeland of three of our crewmembers. They will be remaining here as missionaries. Let’s accompany them ashore.
SPCX2367*#*Could our three civilized companions really come from this savage tribe? Hard to believe. We could build a camp here and stay for a while helping them with their missionary work.
SPCX2368*#*We were away for just a few days and all our things are gone. Could the locals have taken it? There! He has one of our chronometers. We must get them back! They are essential for the survey work.
SPCX2369*#*Let’s pack all we can still use and move on. It seems our three local missionaries fell right in among their kin. We can leave them here and continue our voyage.
SPCX237*#*We could not catch them. They were too fast and we need to continue to the west. But I’ll keep my promise. I will even give you these gems if you get us some new harpoons.
SPCX2370*#*Another ship would help us greatly with the survey work. There might be one for sale at the British colony on the Falkland Islands. We don’t have much money, so we might need to buy an older one.
SPCX2371*#*Let’s transfer the fossils and samples to the new ship. I have already piled up quite the collection. It’s starting to take up a lot of space.
SPCX2372*#*It’s time we headed to the Pacific. I have one special place in mind where I would like to stop, the Galapagos Islands. But first, let’s have a taste of this new kind of fish I have seen in the waters here.
SPCX2373*#*The Galapagos are volcanic islands. I am hoping I will get to see an active volcano there and collect a lot of volcanic rocks. I know you must concentrate on the survey work but you could help me a bit.
SPCX2374*#*I am so excited I can hardly wait until we lower the anchor. First, we will have to build a survey station on the island. Your sailors can help us with that. Then I can start my research.
SPCX2375*#*Do you see that tortoise? It’s like something from the past. I almost expect a dinosaur to pop up from over the treetops. She seems friendly. Let’s get closer and do some measurements.
SPCX2376*#*I have also noticed many interesting kinds of birds. That one seems to be some sort of mockingbird. I will try to catch a few. Do we have crates or cages where I could keep them?
SPCX2377*#*There are so many interesting animals and plants. I think I will need your help collecting the specimens. Take a toolkit and come with me. I will show you what I need you to do.
SPCX2378*#*We can't live only from geology samples. Let's go into the city and buy fresh supplies of food and water. I don’t mind having a taste of the local fauna but we don’t want to become poachers.
SPCX2379*#*The tortoises are stunning, the birds charming but I can’t help but find these iguanas repulsive. Such slimy dark creatures. Still, I should catch one for further research. Let's lure it in with some fish.
SPCX238*#*We have found some exotic drift wood in the sea. I will sell it to you if you are interested. I am sure many beautiful things can be built from it.
SPCX2380*#*It’s time we moved on. Get all the sailors aboard and set the course for Tahiti. What are you looking at? Yes, I took a small tortoise with me. Don’t worry, I won’t eat her. She will be my silent companion.
SPCX2381*#*We will make only a short stop here. I heard that Christianity was brought here by the European missionaries. I would like to have a talk with the locals. Meanwhile, you can take care of the survey work.
SPCX2382*#*Now we can set the course for Australia. There are animals that can be found nowhere else. I can’t wait to explore that land and its wonders. Do we have some empty crates for new samples?
SPCX2383*#*The platypus is an amazing creature, I never saw something like it. I am curious how it came to be. Let’s explore the earth around its nest. Maybe we will find some fossils of its ancestors.
SPCX2384*#*Let me have a look at our schedule. There are still some surveys on the coral atolls planned. And then we can head home. I can find the perfect coral island for our survey by inspecting the local rocks.
SPCX2385*#*We will definitely get great results at the Keeling Islands. Let’s finish our work quickly. It’s been almost five years since we left home. I am going to take a look at the local sea animals.
SPCX2386*#*We will sail home around the southern tip of Africa and then up north to Europe and home. I am going to use this time to clean up my notes. I just need to buy some more paper and ink.
SPCX2387*#*What we found together is the basis for something groundbreaking. Trust me. I just need to consult with my colleagues and think about it some more. So let’s head home!
SPCX2388*#*Welcome, welcome. Charles is already waiting for you. He told me so much about you. But where are my manners? I am Emma Darwin, Charles’s wife.
SPCX2389*#*He will be with you in a second. He is writing his latest book and does not like to be disturbed while he is working. You know him, he lives for his work. Did you bring him the things he forgot on your ship?
SPCX239*#*The weather is nice and sea is calm. I hope that our luck has turned and we will have no more complications. Unfortunately the fish don’t bite here. And I’m hungry.
SPCX2390*#*I don’t know much about his work. For me, it’s all just rocks. But I would love to impress him with some new knowledge. Can you show me how to distinguish the fossils from the ordinary rocks?
SPCX2391*#*Charles has already published a few books based on the notes from your voyage. I have two new signed copies for you. They are somewhere in the pantry. Help me clean it up there so I can find them.
SPCX2392*#*The house is full of Charles’s stuff. Rocks, bones, various tools, and who knows what. A lone woman can’t keep it orderly here. It’s just impossible.
SPCX2393*#*I will make some dinner as a way to thank you all for helping me clean up. I just need to go buy more food so that no one will go hungry. You can go speak to Charles now. I think I heard him leave his room.
SPCX2394*#*He is quite obsessed with his work. When he shuts himself off in his study I like to go to the village and help people, give out some food or coins to the poor, offer some comfort and company to the lonely.
SPCX2395*#*Charles says he is on to something groundbreaking. Your input would be surely valuable. Why don’t you stay with us for a few days? I will clean up the guest room for you. Just bring your things.
SPCX2396*#*Do you know it will be Charles’s birthday soon? I want to give him a new geology kit. But I know hardly anything about such things. If you can get a bunch of them, we could choose the right one together.
SPCX2397*#*Now if I could only make him rest at least for his birthday. Do you still have the HMS Beagle? He would definitely want to sail on her once more. If she is not seaworthy anymore, maybe you could repair her.
SPCX2398*#*He will be so glad to sail on the ship once more. There is one more thing he would like, a new laboratory at home. Help me build it and he will be overjoyed.
SPCX2399*#*On Sunday I am cooking a meal for the poor and I give it out in the church. If Charles does not require your help, you can join me. It would be pleasant to have a new helper in the kitchen.
SPCX240*#*We are nearing some islands. I would like to exchange a few of my men there. I may be a bit paranoid but after so many betrayals can you blame me?
SPCX2400*#*Tomorrow is Charles’s birthday. So get the crew aboard and be ready to set sail. I will come with Charles to the port in the morning. I hope you have planned some exciting voyage for us.
SPCX2401*#*I knew he would be overjoyed. It will do him good to have a break from work. Just wait until he sees the laboratory we had built for him. Did you take care of the tools and equipment too?
SPCX2402*#*I have never been on a ship before. It is wonderful yet my stomach longs to return to a stable ground. Let me disembark here. I will return by a carriage and buy some things for the birthday party later.
SPCX2403*#*How was the voyage? Let’s show Charles the new laboratory. I bet he will want to bring all his stuff inside right away. At least it will free up a bit of space in the house.
SPCX2404*#*The guests will arrive soon. I have invited all Charles’s colleagues and friends. I hope you are prepared for a lot of scientific debates. Hmm, I don’t think we have enough chairs for all of them.
SPCX2405*#*Oh, Charles wants to show to the people the evolution steps of the common fish. The house will smell like fish for a month. But it’s his birthday so let’s indulge him. I can cook the fish afterward.
SPCX2406*#*You have brought so many fish the guests can never eat them all. Just invite your sailors too. They did a good job today on the voyage, they deserve a fine meal.
SPCX2407*#*Help me clean up after the party. We should take the gifts to Charles’s lab. It seems many heard that one joke. What do you give to a geologist as a birthday gift? A pile of rocks.
SPCX2408*#*The birthday party was a bit more expensive than I expected. I will have to cancel the next Sunday meal for the poor. It’s a pity but Charles is always my priority.
SPCX2409*#*That is wonderful. Now I can go buy the groceries for the Sunday meal and you bring the pots and pans to the church. I always cook there. It’s easier than bringing it all from home.
SPCX241*#*The local people live in shacks made from palm leaves. It may be fine in good weather but in a storm it will be no good. Let’s show them how to build proper stone houses.
SPCX2410*#*I bought some vegetables and grains but the fish smelled like they have been out of the water for a long time. Are you good at fishing by any chance?
SPCX2411*#*Charles wants to make a donation to the university where he studied. He thinks that some practical equipment would be a better gift than money. What do you think?
SPCX2412*#*It was great having you here. If you are ever in the area, come visit us. I am sure Charles would be happy too. I will make sure to send you his books right after he finishes writing them.
SPCX2413*#*Pardon me, do you have some money which you could lend me? We are celebrating my promotion with my crew and somehow we are all out of money.
SPCX2414*#*Come, sit down with us. It’s only fair since you paid for this round. There is still free place just bring your chair here.
SPCX2415*#*We are all sailors, as you might have guessed. You are a captain too?! Unbelievable! If your crew is here too, let’s invite them among us. The more, the merrier.
SPCX2416*#*Actually, we could use your help on our next voyage. You just need a good reliable ship and your men. I will take care of everything else. Ah, and the food. You could bring that too.
SPCX2417*#*We are going on a little astronomy mission. We will be watching the stars so we can better measure longitude at sea. If you have a good chronometer, take it with you.
SPCX2418*#*One last drink and then let’s go to bed. We will see each other on the pier in the morning. So to your health and the success of our mission! Cheers!
SPCX2419*#*It’s good to see that you are reliable. Sometimes I make rash decisions when I drink which I later regret. I hope our cooperation is not one of those. So you have the marble I told you to bring?
SPCX242*#*I can’t believe this! We build them houses and they steal from us! I don’t want to stay here any longer than necessary. But let’s try to get our money back from them.
SPCX2420*#*Leave the stone here. It’s for the new headquarters of the Admiralty. And if you can, bring them some wood too.
SPCX2421*#*Sorry for those unexpected requests. I just had to be sure you are resourceful before we set sail. If your sailors are in place, we can head out.
SPCX2422*#*We are heading south-west around Cape Horn and into the Pacific. I hope you have invested in a good reliable compass. We may get separated during a storm.
SPCX2423*#*We need to reach the Tahiti. From there we can observe the transit of Venus across the Sun. I will do the observing, you make sure the natives don’t become angry that we breached their territory.
SPCX2424*#*Here we are. It’s a pleasant place, right? Let’s set a camp before it gets dark. And maybe catch some fish so we have something fresh for dinner.
SPCX2425*#*I hope you slept well. I was up all night watching the sky and taking measurements. Now let’s have some hot cocoa to break our fast and then I have something to tell you.
SPCX2426*#*I have a secret mission to be completed after our official task. We have to look for the elusive Terra Australis, the mysterious Southern Continent. So let’s pack our things and go.
SPCX2427*#*We will need someone to help us navigate through the vast Pacific. The natives might know about the local waters. We should offer them something in return for their help. I am no fan of violent ways.
SPCX2428*#*It seems a local priest called Tupaia has an extensive knowledge of the local geography. He is willing to join our expedition if we help rebuild his shrine. I think we can spare the time.
SPCX2429*#*Our men don’t seem to like the new member of the crew. Let’s have a talk with them. We can’t allow to let it grow into something dangerous.
SPCX243*#*I am so aggravated after this incident! Leaving these cursed islands as soon as possible might help. But I could also use something sweet to calm my nerves.
SPCX2430*#*Tupaia drew a few maps for us. We will set the course to south-west. I am planning to return home by sailing around New Holland. With a bit of luck, we will find Terra Australis along the way.
SPCX2431*#*This land ahead of us, I think Abel Tasman mentions it in his travel journals. It could be worth it to explore it further. Let’s turn south and sail along its coast. I will write my own journal after dinner.
SPCX2432*#*As we are heading further south it’s getting colder outside. But I long to stay on the deck and look at this lovely scenery of snowy peaks towering over green mountains. I need to put on something warm.
SPCX2433*#*It seems we have reached the southernmost point of the island. I will continue mapping the coast but you go ashore and build a base. It might be useful if we decide to colonize this land.
SPCX2434*#*Take Tupaia with you ashore. If you encounter any local tribes, he might be able to translate for you. And have some gifts ready.
SPCX2435*#*So Tupaia was able to make friends with the locals. That is good. Now we just need to fix the loose planks on the hull and then we can head west to Van Diemen’s Land.
SPCX2436*#*This gale is keeping us off course. We are heading north-west instead of south-west. But I can see land in the distance. Prepare for disembarking, we can use a short break on the hard ground.
SPCX2437*#*We are probably on the east coast of New Holland. Let’s stay the night and I will determine our exact location by the stars. Help me get my equipment from the ship.
SPCX2438*#*Let’s continue sailing west and mapping the coast along the way. We should stop in Batavia for supplies before continuing to Europe. We are slowly running out of food.
SPCX2439*#*Tupaia is not feeling well. I fear he got some ugly disease. Our men are hardy but he is not used to a long voyage such as this. Maybe some wine would do him good.
SPCX244*#*At last some luck! We have made a big catch and now have so many fish we have nowhere to store them. Can you get us some barrels?
SPCX2440*#*Poor Tupaia is not getting better. Maybe we should leave him in a hospital in Batavia. I fear that he won’t last until we get to London. I will take care of him, you go buy supplies for us.
SPCX2441*#*We did not discover the South Continent but we have explored a lot of new lands. We have quite some voyage behind us and it can be seen on our ship. She needs some repairs before we can go.
SPCX2442*#*It was a fine voyage with you, captain. Here we say goodbye but I hope you will join me for another voyage in the future. I left some things on your ship, please send them to me when you can.
SPCX2443*#*Good to see you again. I am recruiting sailors for the next voyage. While you tended to your business I finished another expedition seeking the Terra Australis. But this time, we are going north.
SPCX2444*#*The mission is to find the Northwest Passage between Atlantic and Pacific, we will be trying to find it from the west. You should prepare your ship for ice and strengthen her hull with iron.
SPCX2445*#*Officially, we are returning Omai home to Tahiti. He was our local guide during the second voyage. He is a good guy and loves our sweets. He almost did not want to go home because there is no chocolate.
SPCX2446*#*We are ready to head out. I am just going to buy some sauerkraut. It proved to be a great way to keep the men healthy. But I know you love to eat fish, so just take some too.
SPCX2447*#*The merchant raised the price since my last voyage. I don't have enough money on me. Could you lend me a small sum?
SPCX2448*#*We will be sailing east around Africa and then across the Indian Ocean and to the Pacific. We should take some stone to Batavia along the way. There is always a high demand for European marble.
SPCX2449*#*During the next voyage, we should avoid Batavia. Half the crew is sick again. We need to keep them in closed off quarters so they don’t infect the rest of the crew too.
SPCX245*#*While fishing some of our harpoons broke. I don’t want to be ungrateful but try to get some of higher quality next time.
SPCX2450*#*We have dropped off Omai at Tahiti and now we can set the course north. We will still be in a warm climate for some time but let’s check that our ships are in top condition for the icy waters.
SPCX2451*#*This is the first time I have visited these islands. The weather is nice and the people are friendly. We can stop here again on our way back. Now bundle up in a warm cloak and let’s head north.
SPCX2452*#*We are getting into colder waters and look! It’s just teeming here with fish. It’s surprising it’s not too cold for them. Good for us, at least we can have something fresh to eat.
SPCX2453*#*The weather is getting worse. If we manage to anchor near the shore without getting thrown on the rocks, we could wait out the rain on shore. Maybe build a camp and explore the land a bit.
SPCX2454*#*We have been waiting for days yet the weather is not getting better. I say we move on. To the north it is. If we get the chance we should buy some pelts from the locals. It’s getting seriously cold.
SPCX2455*#*Let’s anchor here. There is a village nearby. I saw it from the ship as we sailed along the shore. We will send a few men to trade with the villagers. Let’s hope they are reasonable.
SPCX2456*#*The natives have some otter pelts but they want metal items for it. Pans, weapons, knives, it’s all precious to them. We need those pelts so let’s just give them what they want.
SPCX2457*#*Now I am glad we traded that iron for the pelts. It’s freezing here. As if that was not enough, I have a stomach ache for the past few days. Maybe some wine will help me settle it.
SPCX2458*#*We can’t continue north anymore. The ice is continuous here. We will have to turn back. Maybe we will make a stop at the Sandwich Islands. I have had enough of this cold weather.
SPCX2459*#*That’s what I call a fine welcoming. Everyone is bowing and bringing us food and gifts. Somehow they are friendlier than before, don’t you think? But we don’t need those stone figurines. Return them.
SPCX246*#*We are nearing some islands again. This time I will be more cautious. But let’s try to get on the natives good side with some gifts first. Gold is always a good option.
SPCX2460*#*Hmm, those grilled crabs are amazing. I never ate such scrumptious crustaceans. But it’s been a month since we arrived, it’s time to move on. But first, let’s buy some of those crabs to take with us.
SPCX2461*#*Our foremast broke. We need to return to the bay and repair it. The friendly natives may even help us with that.
SPCX2462*#*What has happened? The savages have become insolent all of a sudden. They even stole our lifeboat! I am taking a few men and going to their king to clear this up one way or another.
SPCX2463*#*Come here! Help me get out of this cell. You must see that a simple old man like me was jailed here unjustly. The guard has the keys. He is asleep, he won’t notice you taking them out of his pocket.
SPCX2464*#*Pardon me, brave captain. I thought you were one of the soldiers fighting in the war. Troy has just escaped this tumultuous time and many Greek soldiers yet remain here. You and your companions look like them.
SPCX2465*#*I am Autolycus, a humble merchant, at your service. Should you ever need something special, you can buy it from me for a modest price. And for freeing me so bravely, I will even grant you a discount.
SPCX2466*#*I will show you the city. After the war, Troy is not as magnificent as it used to be. But the rebuilding of the city promises good business for a merchant like me. And maybe even for you.
SPCX2467*#*I see you are good at acquiring things too. Now, look! This is the famous wooden horse of Troy. It was a bit damaged by fire during the fighting. But I plan on offering my services for its repair.
SPCX2468*#*There are guards on the square. Though falsely accused, they still think me guilty. As if I would ever steal those tridents. But they are quite beautiful. They could be yours in exchange for some good wine.
SPCX2469*#*Hah, that’s the best deal you ever made, friend. I am regretting now I gave it to you so cheap. But you saved me, so you deserve it. Enjoy! Let’s go to a tavern, some food will improve my mood.
SPCX247*#*The local ruler is named Humabon and he is friendly. He has asked me to help him defeat his rival from the other island. I might do that but first I will need more men.
SPCX2470*#*So you are leaving Troy soon? I hope the Greek soldiers will leave as well so the city can get back to the way it was. Shall we go? Oh, I thought you would pay for the dinner.
SPCX2471*#*Come, I will accompany you to the port. It will be busy there but with my help, we will get to your ship in no time. I hope your sailors are already waiting for you there.
SPCX2472*#*It was a pleasure, captain. Especially since I am free thanks to you. Well, fair winds home and should you ever need something, my shop is always open for you.
SPCX2473*#*Are you heading home too? Join my fleet and we can sail together. We will overcome any obstacles easier should they arrive. I am just finishing the last repairs on my ship.
SPCX2474*#*I am Odysseus and these are my men. All brave Greek warriors. You don’t have to worry about anything happening to you when you are with us. Just bring some wine and we will do everything to save your life.
SPCX2475*#*We are heading back to Ithaca across the Aegean Sea. I did not want to take part in this war and leave my wife Penelope at home alone. Now I have to bury half my men but at least I can go home.
SPCX2476*#*The sooner we take off, the sooner we will be home. So let’s set sails and head west. When you can take a break from commanding the ship, come and join me for a meal. I will tell you stories from the war.
SPCX2477*#*This storm is keeping us off course. This way we won’t arrive in Ithaca for a long time. There is an island in the distance. Let’s anchor there and wait out the storm. Ready the anchor.
SPCX2478*#*I will take a few men and look around the island. Looks like this voyage will be prolonged and we will need more supplies. You stay with the ships for now and look out for any danger.
SPCX2479*#*We have found a cave full of food and casks with fresh water. I can’t believe our good luck. Take some crates for transporting the supplies and come with me.
SPCX248*#*Humabon has convinced me to help him. But we need to talk about the details of his plan first. Talking business is always more pleasant over dinner.
SPCX2480*#*Someone is coming. Quick, hide! Whoever it is, they won’t be happy we are stealing their food. Don’t worry, I plan on leaving some gold behind as a payment. I just can’t risk them saying no to the trade.
SPCX2481*#*I never saw such a large man. He killed two of my soldiers as if they were flies and barricaded the entrance with a huge stone. At least we won’t starve here but once he comes back he could kill us all.
SPCX2482*#*We have to get him drunk, maybe then we will be able to slip through. He took his sheep to the pasture, we will have time until the evening to prepare. Some of these amphorae should have wine in it.
SPCX2483*#*He sat in the entrance the whole time. It was not possible to pass around him. But at least I managed to blind him. Don’t worry, I have a plan. Just lend me your knife.
SPCX2484*#*Trust me, just put that sheepskin on and follow my lead. And not a word until we are all out of here.
SPCX2485*#*Ha! You thought you could keep Odysseus locked up! You are a fool! Be glad I took only your eye. Captain! He is throwing stones at us! Be careful not to get hit.
SPCX2486*#*He broke half of our oars! We won’t be able to sail off from the bay if we don’t find some replacement fast.
SPCX2487*#*We escaped but only barely. Without food and without some of my men. We have no choice but to try to catch some fish now. But first, let’s put more distance between us and that monster.
SPCX2488*#*Let’s help the men calm down with a bit of wine. I am sure they won’t refuse. But dilute it with water. We saw how too much alcohol can make a man or a monster vulnerable. We don’t need that.
SPCX2489*#*The winds are taking us in the opposite direction than we need to go. I see another island before us. Hopefully, we will be able to buy supplies there. This time, I am offering the gold first.
SPCX249*#*Let’s try to come to Humabon’s rival with a friendly offer of trade. He might be interested in some pretty marble. They don’t have such stone here on the islands.
SPCX2490*#*Time to disembark. I hope you have a sword or a knife with you. I know you are no warrior but who knows what monsters lurk in the forest. I will go in first and check if it is safe.
SPCX2491*#*There is a beautiful garden full of animals, all strangely tame. My men went ahead. Take what you need to build a camp and go after them. I am going to give instructions to the men on the ship.
SPCX2492*#*Before I go, we need some materials to repair the ships damaged by that crazy giant. Do you happen to have some on your ship? It would help us greatly.
SPCX2493*#*You have arrived at the Island of Circe. You must be tired, hungry, and thirsty. Please, sit down and drink some wine and taste the cheese. Don’t mind the animals, they are all harmless.
SPCX2494*#*I see you are quite clever. You brought your own wine. But to escape my anger you will have to do more than that. No one just enters my island and escapes free!
SPCX2495*#*Sometimes I long to hear the fine cords of a lyre. Yet these pigs are no good at playing. Play something for me and maybe I will be merciful. But I would like to hear a whole orchestra play.
SPCX2496*#*It’s not easy to please me yet you have not failed at this task. Fine, you shall not have to wallow and grunt at my feet. Your friend Odysseus might not be so lucky. He will have to pass the test too.
SPCX2497*#*He is a clever one too. He managed to escape my snare as well. Fine, you can remain here. I can be a pleasant hostess too. Especially when you make me happy with something glittery.
SPCX2498*#*You can leave whenever you please. But where would you go? There is everything you need here. I could use your company too. My beautiful villa has taken some damage over the years. You know how to build, right?
SPCX2499*#*The noise of the construction work is deafening. I would like to hear the lyres again. But the ones you bought before were too cheap. I require something of higher quality.
SPCX250*#*The negotiations did not go well and then they attacked us. I barely escaped with my life. We will need some crutches for our injured.
SPCX2500*#*And I need a larger bed made of cedar wood. And don’t forget the canopy! Don’t worry about your friend Odysseus, he is just fine. I need you to concentrate on your work.
SPCX2501*#*Do you want to feed the lions? They are just like overgrown cats, so I feed them fish. Or whatever I have on the table. And the pigs need feeding too.
SPCX2502*#*I know there are still some sailors hiding on your ships. How about you bring them to me. I am sure they would like it here more than on those uncomfortable water coffins.
SPCX2503*#*It’s been some time since you arrived at my island. I hope you truly enjoy it here and don’t plan on leaving. I see everything and weapons would not help you here. But you are free to try.
SPCX2504*#*I will have a romantic dinner with Odysseus on the beach. He does not like my wine. Get some that would satisfy his taste. Something from Ithaca perhaps.
SPCX2505*#*That has been a mistake. The wine has reminded him of home and his wife. I could make him stay but I don’t need another obedient animal. But if you want to leave too, you will have to buy your freedom.
SPCX2506*#*Don’t worry I will find a replacement for you soon enough. But before you go, there is still some work to do on my mansion. You would not leave your work unfinished, would you?
SPCX2507*#*You might want to check on your ships. There was quite a storm a few months ago. Who knows if they are in any shape to get back on the sea. Maybe you will have to stay here after all.
SPCX2508*#*So you are not just a captain but a shipwright too. Pft! Whatever. Just don’t forget your men here. These lazy fools are no good to me anyway.
SPCX2509*#*You are still here? You don’t know where to go, right? Yes, my island is a bit out of the way. I would be happy to help. For a price.
SPCX251*#*This was a failure. At least I am still alive and we can continue on our journey. But now let’s take a few days respite and enjoy something sweet to lessen the pain.
SPCX2510*#*There are two ways from here to Ithaca. One leads along the great whirlpool and some believe there also hides a hideous monster nearby. But if you are brave and foolish, you could make it.
SPCX2511*#*The other way leads through the Wandering Rocks. But only the Argo ever passed through there and it is said they had divine help. It’s up to you. But I would eat well tonight. It might be your last meal.
SPCX2512*#*Since you are truly departing my island, won’t you leave me something to remember you by? I so love the music of your lyres. Maybe a few of them as a farewell gift?
SPCX2513*#*Captain! I am so sorry! We should have been far away from here long ago. Let’s set sail and leave this island behind us. Just count your men. We should not leave anyone behind.
SPCX2514*#*We are heading for the whirlpool. If there is really a monster, as they say, we won’t give up without a fight. We will need as many arrows as we can make. We don’t want it to get too close.
SPCX2515*#*Circe warned me that we will pass by the sirens, allegedly monstrous women with wings singing to lure men to their deaths. I bet these are just some strange birds. We will scare them off with rocks.
SPCX2516*#*But we have seen many strange things... All sailors must put wax in their ears so they won’t hear a thing and tie me up to the main mast. I am just too curious what this is all about. You can use these chains.
SPCX2517*#*I hope you got all that wax out of your ear. We must get out of here quickly. Just in case something can still be heard, put on a helmet. Take one for each man. Don’t look back!
SPCX2518*#*We should arrive at the whirlpool tomorrow. We need to keep our distance from it or it will drag us to the bottom. If we really meet this fabled monster, it might leave us alone once we feed it.
SPCX2519*#*The whirlpool is enormous. We must sail as far from it as the strait allows. I just hope no monster will jump at us there. Maybe a small offering to Poseidon will grant us safe passage.
SPCX252*#*Humabon’s people have helped us greatly and many of our men were saved thanks to them. I would like to give them some more gold for their help.
SPCX2520*#*We are almost past Charybdis. We made it. No! What is this? Quick! Everyone who has no oar in hand, grab a bow and shoot! Now!
SPCX2521*#*Six men overboard! Let’s save them! But don’t give your own life to do that, do you hear me? Every life is precious.
SPCX2522*#*We could not save them. This is a sad day but we must continue home. Once we are back in Ithaca I will have a statue made for each one we lost on this voyage.
SPCX2523*#*The men are tired and beg me to stop at Thrinacia. It is the nearest island from here. But Circe warned me about going there. What do you think, captain, should we stop there?
SPCX2524*#*So you answer like a true Greek warrior, with steel. Fine, let’s hope the swords and armor will protect us from whatever danger lurks there. Change the course for the island!
SPCX2525*#*The island looks uninhabited. There is just a large herd of cattle. Let’s keep away from it. Who knows who the owner is. We don’t want to make enemies. Let’s just catch some fish instead.
SPCX2526*#*If this wind won’t stop, we won’t be able to sail out of the bay. Let’s build a camp at the shore for now. I hope we won’t have to stay for long, but it’s good to have a shelter.
SPCX2527*#*It’s been nearly a month and we still can’t leave. We have already fished out the nearby waters and the men are getting nervous. Maybe an offering to the gods would grant us good weather so we can leave.
SPCX2528*#*The wind has truly calmed down. Who knows if it is a miracle or just luck. Let’s find the men and board the ships before the weather gets worse again.
SPCX2529*#*A sailor just told me they have killed some cows on the island. I explicitly told them not to. But we are away from there, so let’s hope we escaped the trouble. I hope you have not taken anything from there.
SPCX253*#*Now it’s time to set sails again. Unfortunately while we were here an anchor on one of our ships has corroded. Quickly get us a new one so we can leave soon.
SPCX2530*#*The good weather did not last long. This is the most vicious storm I experienced at sea. A big wave incoming! Hold on to something!
SPCX2531*#*I was afraid I was the only one. Did you see someone else come ashore? The heavy armor must have dragged them to the bottom as we were struck by the lightning. Look! There is some armor on the beach.
SPCX2532*#*No, those were just empty helmets. So we are alone now. Let’s gather some food or I might just die from hunger soon. Then we can go inland. Maybe we will find some people who will help us.
SPCX2533*#*There! Do you see that pretty blond girl? Let me just go and ask her for help. I will be back shortly. You try to salvage some gold from the wreck. It could help us get home.
SPCX2534*#*I am so sorry, captain. You were wise not to approach her. She must have put a spell on me or something. I almost forgot about my beloved Penelope. Let’s build a raft and get out of here.
SPCX2535*#*We are stranded once again. I did not expect to go far on that raft anyway. How are you feeling? Everything ok? Nothing broken? Then let’s wait out the storm in that cave on the cliffs.
SPCX2536*#*There are some people on the beach. Let’s hope they will help us get back to Ithaca. I will go talk to them but you stay hidden and if you can find some weapon it might become useful.
SPCX2537*#*They took me to their king, Alcinous. His men will take us home. We just need to pick up some of his sailors along the way. They had some secret mission as I understand but he would not say what it was.
SPCX2538*#*How many years has it been? I can’t believe I am finally home. The king Alcinous and the men who took us here will all receive a helmet of Ithaca as a sign that they are always welcome here.
SPCX2539*#*I want to see what has happened in my kingdom since I was home. Oh, I forgot to mention I am the king of Ithaca. Let’s dress up as poor fishermen and approach the palace.
SPCX254*#*We are not sailing more than a few days and already it seems our main ship is taking on water. Send some sailors to gather wood on the island nearby for the repairs.
SPCX2540*#*My house is full of suitors for my Penelope. But she is clever, she made them compete for her by shooting from the Bow of Apollo. I must get to the competition. We will have to bribe the guards to let us in.
SPCX2541*#*None of those fools could string that bow. Only me. I won the contest and it’s time to reveal my true identity to my faithful Penelope. For that, I need my shining armor so let’s visit the smith.
SPCX2542*#*Now that I am back on my throne, I can help you get home too. I will have a fleet of ships made for you. I hope you have a faithful partner waiting there for you too.
SPCX2543*#*Are you interested in a fine deal? My brother Autolycus will not speak to me. We have had some arguments in the past. But I need the Drachmas he has to do business in Greece. Will you help me?
SPCX2544*#*Are you going to the Amazon? I need a passage to Brazil. I am going to finish the exploration of the river. Do you think 30 dollars will cover the voyage?
SPCX2545*#*I am going to keep looking for a ship that will take me there. With the money you gave me, I will surely reach my destination. Thanks a lot, captain. Farewell.
SPCX2546*#*Oh, you are here too. I just found out that the ship heading for Brazil left yesterday. There is none departing for another month. I can only drink to my sorrow now, the food here is terrible.
SPCX2547*#*There go my dreams of a grand career as an adventurer. Actually, I wanted to be a pilot of a steamboat first, but that did not work out either. I guess I will just load up crates on ships at the port.
SPCX2548*#*Do you own some steamships, captain? Maybe I can help out on one of your boats on the Mississippi. I know the river and I am a quick learner. Just ask your sailors if they would teach me.
SPCX2549*#*The pilot of the steamboat Paul Jones, Mr. Bixby, will take me as an apprentice. I can’t believe it. This is a dream come true! I will take my things and be at the pier right away. Which ship is it?
SPCX255*#*Unfortunately the ship is still not in a good shape. We better send her home the way we came. We should give the men some of our provisions for the trip.
SPCX2550*#*I need to look presentable for my first day at work. Where did I put my razor blade? Do you have one I could borrow? Oh, I can choose one from the lost and found crate?
SPCX2551*#*I don’t have much money but I promised to pay your pilot for teaching me from my first wage. I will get one, right?
SPCX2552*#*When are we leaving the port? I am ready to start learning. Oh, I see. We still need to load up those materials. I will help if it will make us leave faster.
SPCX2553*#*I am so tired. I never thought piloting a steamboat would be so exhausting. Did I miss the dinner? I hope there is still some food left.
SPCX2554*#*What? Is it morning already? But outside is still dark. What do you mean the pilots have to get up early? I am just an apprentice. Fine, I can also help load more fuel to the furnace as I go up.
SPCX2555*#*I slept for maybe four hours. Will it be like this every night? Do you have some coffee at least? There is none in the official rations??? Maybe one of the sailors will have some. I will ask around.
SPCX2556*#*Mr. Bixby doubtlessly already told you that I make a pretty lousy pilot. I could not remember a single point on the river he told me about. I must write it all down from now on.
SPCX2557*#*Is it time for the first payout already? I heard the sailors planning an evening at the Tavern tomorrow. I am trying to do my best too. I remember a few points along the river already.
SPCX2558*#*I have lost my razor blade. Could I check the lost and found stash once more? Hopefully, someone found it and left it there.
SPCX2559*#*This razor is completely blunt. It cannot be mine. Or someone used it without my knowledge. I need a sharpening stone. Maybe some of the rocks we are transporting will serve.
SPCX256*#*Let’s make some last repairs on the ship and let’s go. We need to continue to our destination. It should not be far now.
SPCX2560*#*The night shifts are the worst. You can’t see a thing in the darkness and if you don’t know the river by heart you can easily hit rocks in the water. I would build fires on the shore if I had any say in it.
SPCX2561*#*How long are we staying in town? I could use a break from work. I sleep only four hours each night. What? Do you really need me to go for the supplies with you?
SPCX2562*#*There, the ship pantry is well stocked. I would like to get a bit of sleep now. I hope your sailors will unload the cargo. I really have no strength left.
SPCX2563*#*Have we left the port already? No? If we need to make some repairs, I will go ashore for a while. What? Why must I help? It was not my fault we scratched those rocks yesterday.
SPCX2564*#*I am starting to think this is not really a job for me. I can’t remember the river like Mr. Bixby. But my adventures would make up a good story. Maybe I will publish it once I save up some money.
SPCX2565*#*I just came from the boiler room. The guys said we don’t have enough wood to get to New Orleans. We should probably make a stop somewhere and load up more fuel.
SPCX2566*#*I want to make friends with the crew. And I have just thought of the perfect way. How about I give each one a shining new razor blade. Every man needs to look presentable from time to time.
SPCX2567*#*And let’s make it a set with a sharpening stone and I will write a personal note for each one. You know, I quite started to like writing. I think I could come up with some interesting stories too.
SPCX2568*#*I think I am starting to get into it. I remember most of the main points along the river and I can read the signs on the water. Those bubbles over there mean there is a lot of fish waiting to become our dinner.
SPCX2569*#*Captain! Mr. Bixby sent me to tell you that there is a large fallen tree blocking our path. We need to cut it down to continue down the river. I hope you have some axes on the ship. We will need them.
SPCX257*#*At last we are here, the Spice Islands. We have to take as much of the spices as we can fit inside our ships. But the merchant wants a lot of precious stones for them.
SPCX2570*#*Now that we have the axes we can get that tree out of the way. I will help too. The more men will join in cutting the tree the faster we can move on.
SPCX2571*#*Most of the tree is already cut down and our way forward free. Let’s get the wood aboard. We could use it as fuel. What do you say? Isn’t that a brilliant idea?
SPCX2572*#*These are the last few days of my apprenticeship. Mr. Bixby does not think I am ready to become a pilot but I should still pay him. He did his best. I am probably just not made for this kind of work.
SPCX2573*#*I may not become a great pilot but I know how to make the perfect fish stew. I want to say goodbye to all the guys aboard with one last dinner. Will you help me prepare it?
SPCX2574*#*Here to see the show? I am afraid, we are not playing tonight. But if you help me out a bit, I will get you to the play for free.
SPCX2575*#*Have you been on a showboat before? We are like a traveling theatre, moving along the river. We have very talented actors. They just need a few props and they can do wonders on stage.
SPCX2576*#*So you are a captain. That’s wonderful! I just got my pilot’s license recently. I will be taking turns at the rudder with my husband. I could use your advice. The most difficult are the technical parts.
SPCX2577*#*Please, let your crew know about our theatre. We would be pleased to welcome you all aboard. We will be playing Romeo and Juliet, the romantic classic by Shakespeare.
SPCX2578*#*I need to get a fake balcony for Romeo and Juliet. You know the balcony scene? It’s essential to the whole play. We had a beautiful balcony made from cedar wood but the wood-worms got into it.
SPCX2579*#*The play is tomorrow at seven pm. Please be on time. We don’t let anyone in after the start of the show. Your men will have to buy the tickets. We can’t let so many people in for free.
SPCX258*#*Now let’s head home. I can’t wait to see my family again. We just need to buy some supplies for the remaining part of our voyage.
SPCX2580*#*I know you have some urgent business, captain. New houses are built in New Orleans every day. Someone needs to deliver the materials. But please try to come on time for the show.
SPCX2581*#*Some of these wigs are not good at all. The hair is flying all over the place. If you could get me some new ones from the town, I would be very grateful.
SPCX2582*#*As one of our VIP’s, you are invited to the afterparty. There will be some light refreshment and drinks. Of course, you can bring something more if you want.
SPCX2583*#*How did you like the show? I prefer more comedic plays, but Romeo and Juliet is always fully booked. Can you come tomorrow and look at our steam engine? Something is not working right.
SPCX2584*#*It looks like the engine is working fine now. Tomorrow we plan on moving to the next town so the boat must be in perfect state until then. Maybe your sailors can check the rest of the boat.
SPCX2585*#*Is it repaired? Thank you so much. Now we need only some fuel and we can move on. Will you accompany us to the next town?
SPCX2586*#*We are going to Cairo next. No, not to Egypt, you silly. It’s a town at the confluence of Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. There is a wonderful costume shop. But I will have to get a loan to buy new dresses.
SPCX2587*#*I will return everything after our next show, I promise. Now we just need to get passing wigs to the costumes. Will you help me choose? It’s fun trying out different wigs.
SPCX2588*#*It seems the pier in Cairo has been damaged by the high water we had in spring. We could go further down the river and look for a good place to anchor. But we may have to build the access road.
SPCX2589*#*I am going to oversee the preparations for our next show. If you are going to visit the town, please get us some supplies. We are all out of food. Some fresh fish would be nice.
SPCX259*#*I hope there will be no more complications. If my calculations are correct we should arrive home soon. Let’s celebrate that with a bit of chocolate.
SPCX2590*#*There is a flu spreading among our backstage workers. It is possible we will need to find some temporary replacement for them. It is not a difficult job, even your sailors could do it.
SPCX2591*#*The main stairway in the auditorium is creaking ominously. I am afraid it will break down once the visitors arrive. We need to have a new one made. And this time, with an iron construction.
SPCX2592*#*Fine, it already looks much better. Now we need only the planks for the stairs. The Sensation is an old showboat so it needs repairs from time to time. But she is a part of the family now.
SPCX2593*#*We have started saving up for a piece of land where we could live after retiring. I love this life but at some point, I would just like to settle in one place in a regular house.
SPCX2594*#*Do you know where to get good and cheap materials for a house? We will need some advice. I can do many things but building a house is not something I have done before.
SPCX2595*#*Penny from the showboat Sunny South asked me to lend them some wigs. One of their actors had lice and now all their wigs are infected. Unpleasant business. Let’s hope our wigs stay clean.
SPCX2596*#*As you might have noticed our Sensation is just a houseboat. It is towed by a small steamship. We have saved up some money and want to buy a new steamer. You are an expert on ships, will you help us?
SPCX2597*#*Sometimes we don’t even ask for money to enter our shows. We let people in for a bunch of apples or a couple of ripe tomatoes. With a few more ingredients, we can make a fine meal of it.
SPCX2598*#*We have collected a lot of food from the last show. Invite your sailors for dinner tomorrow. We need to eat it before it goes bad.
SPCX2599*#*I plan a new kind of show at our theatre. It will be a puppet show. I have already a play in mind and I have finished the design of the puppets too. Now we just need to make them.
SPCX260*#*Here we are, home again. I can already see my family waiting on the pier. I have completely forgotten about a gift for my son. Let’s make him a rocking horse.
SPCX2600*#*I don’t want to let go of our actors and staff and I can’t afford to pay professional puppeteers. Our actors will take a few lessons in puppeteering. It will still cost something but not as much.
SPCX2601*#*These puppets must look beautiful. We have already finished the wooden bodies but now we need to give them some hair and paint their faces. We could use some old wigs for the hair.
SPCX2602*#*Perfect! Our new puppets are ready. How is our staff progressing with the study of puppeteering? Are we ready for our first puppet show? We are still missing the wires to move the puppets.
SPCX2603*#*For all your help you get a seat in the front row. Now you can sit down and get ready to enjoy the show. I understand you must return to your work soon. But I hope you will find some time to watch our show.
SPCX2604*#*Oi, hello there, young fella’. Sorry to bother you but do you have a coin for an old unfortunate fisherman? I could not catch a fish worth a cent in months. I live from seaweed and snails.
SPCX2605*#*Thank you very much, friend. Come to my cabin. I may not have much to eat but I have some good drink. But watch where you step! The floor is rotting under my feet.
SPCX2606*#*Here, this will warm you up! So tell me, captain, are you also good at fishing? Would you mind giving a hand to an old man in need?
SPCX2607*#*Hohoho! I see you know your way around fish. Good! I just needed someone like you. You see, there is a tale of this legendary tuna. If I catch it, I will be taken care of for the rest of my days.
SPCX2608*#*So you have brought your own fishing gear. But don’t think you can catch it without me! No, no, you won’t leave old Santiago out of this. Now get that cargo out of your ship, we need to be fast.
SPCX2609*#*So come on! Show me that your fancy gear is worth something. Try using it in the bay, I have not caught even a little fish here in years. Maybe the water here is stinky.
SPCX261*#*Me name is Edward Teach, but all the men know me as the terrible captain Blackbeard. Arrr that’s me. Now bring me somethin’ to eat before I throw ye to the sharks.
SPCX2610*#*Now you have shamed poor old Santiago. But who cares about some small fish! My knowledge will surely help us catch the tuna. Everyone knows what a tuna eats but I know that he likes sardines most.
SPCX2611*#*I doubt I can catch the tuna with this old fishing rod and rusty harpoon. If I only had money for a new fishing gear like yours. But I guess a poor old man has to do with what he has.
SPCX2612*#*You know how a tuna looks, right? Bring me different kinds of fish and I will teach you which is which. Many small fish are food for the tuna so where you see them, there might be a tuna too.
SPCX2613*#*Wonderful! Now we are ready to start the hunt for real. I will go ahead and scout the waters with my small boat. But I need to patch up that hole on the bottom first.
SPCX2614*#*Ouch! I just hit my finger with the hammer. My eyes are not what they used to be. Neither is my aim. Don’t worry, I will finish the repair in a day or two. But if you are in a hurry, you could help me.
SPCX2615*#*The legend says the tuna likes warm waters, so he could be swimming in the shallows near an island such as this. Let’s throw our nets around these rocks here.
SPCX2616*#*To the sea it is! The legendary tuna should have bright golden stripes along its body that should help us spot him. Now let’s spread the nets around and hope we will get him.
SPCX2617*#*Did you catch something? Only sardines? Yes, that’s about the only thing I can catch too. But we can use them as bait and they don’t taste so bad on the grill either.
SPCX2618*#*I have a good feeling about these waters. Let’s spread the nets around and put some of the sardines on the hook. You bought some hooks, right? Without them, it will be hard to catch the tuna.
SPCX2619*#*Only seaweed got tangled up in the nets. I would be a bit disappointed if we caught the tuna so quickly. And I have thought of a new way how to get him. Let’s make some wooden poles with spiky ends!
SPCX262*#*So ye wanna be a pirate, matey? I’ve got an offer for ye. Get me some gold and I might show ye how to get into the sweet trade.
SPCX2620*#*Yes, yes, it was a bit foolish trying to impale the tuna when we can’t even find him. Maybe if we dive underwater we can spot him. The divers use a big metal tank to breathe underwater, right?
SPCX2621*#*While we wait for our guys to resurface, let’s taste those fish we managed to catch until now. I got hungry from all that fishing.
SPCX2622*#*One of your sailors caught something and it’s big! We are not strong enough to pull it out of the water. We will need some counterweight to get it aboard the ship.
SPCX2623*#*It’s a giant octopus! And it has little babies squirming out from under its tentacles. Quick! Catch them before they hide on the ship. I don’t want to smell drying octopus for the rest of the voyage.
SPCX2624*#*Did we get them all? I can still smell them. Let’s look through the crates on board, I bet there are still some baby octopuses hiding inside.
SPCX2625*#*What have you found? A bunch of old fish? We must have forgotten them after the last haul. They are good for nothing now. Let’s just throw them overboard.
SPCX2626*#*Slimy creatures! I need to wash now. After so many nights at sea, I really need it. Maybe we could stop at the nearest town and sleepover in a tavern. A good rest will help us recover.
SPCX2627*#*Now, full of new energy, we can continue our hunt for the legendary tuna. So sharpen our harpoons and let’s get back to the open sea!
SPCX2628*#*I think we should concentrate on choosing the right bait and the tuna will swim right into our arms. Otherwise, we can look for him years without luck. Maybe the sardines did not interest him.
SPCX2629*#*There! Do you see the golden stripes under the surface? That’s it! The legendary tuna. Let’s try to lure it to the nearest shallows. Maybe your sailors can go ahead and build a barrier there.
SPCX263*#*The first lesson is a lesson of value. Ye can rob a ship full of gold and precious stones or one full of rocks. But don’t despair, ye can sell everything for a price.
SPCX2630*#*He does not want to go to the nets we prepared. We need to catch him with the bait. Do we still have some? Even octopuses will do.
SPCX2631*#*We have him! Hold the fishing rod, it can’t break or the tuna will be gone. We may never have a chance like this again.
SPCX2632*#*Help me get him aboard! He is enormous. Careful that he won’t slip away. You know what? Without you, I never would have caught him. So for a few coins, the legendary tuna will be all yours.
SPCX2633*#*It was a pleasure fishing with you. With all the fish we caught on this voyage, I will be rich even without the legendary tuna. I will have enough money to retire on a pleasant tropic island.
SPCX2634*#*We know you are a competent captain but are you also a good fisherman? Prove your fishing skills and obtain a great ship which will help you on your exploration voyages.
SPCX2635*#*Pardon me, captain. Can I ask for a minute of your time? I would invite you for a cup of tea but I forgot my purse at home. I hope you don’t mind.
SPCX2636*#*I am in need of some transportation service. My fiancé was supposed to help me with the wedding preparations but he is on a business trip in Europe. He did not even stay to finish the renovation of our house.
SPCX2637*#*The wedding will take place on a small island near where I grew up so everything needs to be delivered by ship. I will show your sailors where it is so you can easily find it.
SPCX2638*#*There is nothing on the island. We will have to bring everything from the food to a shelter in case of bad weather. Let’s make it a large tent with a solid iron frame to withstand the wind from the sea.
SPCX2639*#*Jonathan, that’s my fiancé, does not like meat very much. He prefers vegetables and fish. But I am not much of a fish eater myself. Will you help me choose the right menu?
SPCX264*#*A most important thing for a pirate is a ship. Ye don’t need to build a new one from the scratch, just patch up the one ye...find on yer adventures.
SPCX2640*#*The decoration will be beautiful. Apart from flowers, there will be mirrors hanging from the branches of trees. They will reflect the sky and the sunlight so that it will all look like a fairyland.
SPCX2641*#*I have ordered special chairs and tables for the wedding. Pick them up at the Wedding Woodworkers. They should be ready by now.
SPCX2642*#*The chairs are beautiful. Just like I pictured them. Alas, they came out more expensive than I expected. Could you give me a small loan, captain?
SPCX2643*#*Now please take some marble to the stonemason. I have already delivered him the design of the stone altar I wish to make my vows at. And remember, it needs to be a pink marble.
SPCX2644*#*I have been so busy with the wedding I totally forgot Jonathan should be back by now. Will you ask your men to inquire about his ship in the port?
SPCX2645*#*His ship has already arrived? How could it be? Let’s find the captain of the ship. I must ask him about Jonathan. If we deliver the supplies for their next voyage, they should let us inside easier.
SPCX2646*#*The captain knew nothing about Jonathan. We must ask the passengers. The captain said most of them were the workers from the local Iron Factory. Let’s go there with a delivery of material.
SPCX2647*#*No one knew anything about Jonathan. Maybe he missed the ship and will come with the next one. But it’s been five days now. As if this was not terrible enough a storm has broken all the mirrors for my wedding.
SPCX2648*#*I have thought about asking someone sailing to Romania to look for my fiancé. But there are no ships heading in that direction. Maybe if I offer a reward, I will find someone willing to go there.
SPCX2649*#*No one will go, so I will do it myself. I will have a ship built and sail to Romania. I may not know where it is but my heart will guide me.
SPCX265*#*Ye can’t do this business alone, matey. Ye need some men ye can trust. With them and a fast ship yer journey to become a pirate can start.
SPCX2650*#*Will you help me find some sailors who will sail with me?
SPCX2651*#*My father became sick. I can’t leave him now. Captain, you are my last hope. Will you sail to Romania for me? I know you are busy with your own business, but once you finish it, please help me find Jonathan.
SPCX2652*#*I will wait patiently for any news about Jonathan. Please, find him for me. He was going to the estate of Count Dracula. I heard Transylvania is a very poor country so take enough supplies with you.
SPCX2653*#*Please take some money with you in case pirates or bandits have my poor Jonathan. Give them the money so they would let him go free. I can’t bear the thought anything bad would happen to him.
SPCX2654*#*Take the ship I had made. She is not perfect now but I am sure she can be made into a magnificent vessel. Place some mirrors on her. They ward off evil. You are going into dark lands.
SPCX2655*#*There is a dangerous creature sailing through these waters. He looks human but he is far from it. Don’t get close to him! But if you can’t help it, grab some sharp weapon at least.
SPCX2656*#*Iron won’t do him much harm. If you have some spare wood on your ship, make stakes out of it. They will help you more. You can’t kill this blood-sucking monster easily.
SPCX2657*#*I have been hunting him since he left the shores of Romania. He plans something sinister, I am sure. Warn your sailors to be alert. He could strike anytime.
SPCX2658*#*With your help, captain, we can get him. I am sure of it. Now, do you have the wooden stakes ready? Then let’s go after that monster!
SPCX2659*#*It’s good to see you here, captain. That devil will surely try to lure you to his side. But it would cost you more than just your life. So stay with me and let's go buy some silver and holy water.
SPCX266*#*No pirate goes around unarmed. Ye need a nice cutlass and a pair of pistols. For a few precious stones I will give you a good material for the blacksmith to make them.
SPCX2660*#*He does not like the sun. So if he is not holed up on that ship of his, he will be in some dark pit. We could try to lure him into a trap by building a nice empty tomb for him in London.
SPCX2661*#*I have an informant in the village near the Count’s castle. He informed me of the fiend’s relocation. People in the village are really poor. I always send them some food to help them out.
SPCX2662*#*You have brought the silver from the town? Good. I will make the arrowheads for my crossbow from it. What I need now is some timber.
SPCX2663*#*Did you need something? Yes, in a moment. I need to have a few words with your sailors about fighting these blood-sucking fiends. We need to be ready for an attack at all times.
SPCX2664*#*You are looking for Jonathan Harker? Never heard of him. But if he was going to the Count’s castle, I would say he is dead. You should give up on him and help me avenge his death instead.
SPCX2665*#*My family has been on the hunt for hundreds of years. Time has taught us how to destroy these creatures. A wooden stake in the heart works best. The second option is burning.
SPCX2666*#*We must not allow the Count to reach London. Who knows what horror he would wreak there. We should pay the dockmaster to look out for suspicious ships arriving at night.
SPCX2667*#*We need to stop at a tavern. I can’t eat just garlic anymore. It’s healthy and the fiend hates the smell, but my stomach is protesting this diet.
SPCX2668*#*You know, you disappeared for quite some time when our ships sailed apart. Are you sure you did not get close to the Count’s vessel? Let me check your throat for a moment. And your sailors too.
SPCX2669*#*I am glad, you are all fine. I did not suspect you of anything, just being cautious. Now help me prepare some arrows for my crossbow. We are nearing the Count’s ship.
SPCX267*#*Let’s not forget one more important thing and that are the looks. Ye need to inspire fright in yer enemies on sight. A good hat will help ye with that.
SPCX2670*#*I can’t believe we caught up with him already. Prepare to board the ship. But wait! This is not the Count’s ship. These are pirates! Get ready to fight!
SPCX2671*#*Those bloody pirates! They got us good but we withstood the attack. But we should prepare some ammunition in case of another encounter. Some rocks will do until we reach a town with a shop.
SPCX2672*#*We need to treat the wounded and when we reach the next village, take them to a real doctor. It won’t be cheap, but we need those men to win our fight.
SPCX2673*#*A lot of men have broken limbs. We need to get some makeshift splints to fix the broken arms and legs. Some wood will do. I will show you how to make the splint.
SPCX2674*#*If you have some wood left, make more stakes. There is never enough of them.
SPCX2675*#*This must be the Count’s ship. We need your men to be brave and fight. Make sure they know their families will be taken care of should anything happen to them.
SPCX2676*#*We are close enough to hurl stones at his ship with the trebuchets and fire the cannons. We just want to weaken the vessels defenses, the Count will not drown if the ship sinks.
SPCX2677*#*Now is the time to board his ship. Take care of the rudder. You don’t need to do the fighting. That’s what we are here for. My men and I will get those monsters. But be prepared to defend yourself.
SPCX2678*#*Captain, are you alright? We got his minions, but the Count escaped. It was foolish to fight him on a cloudy day. It cost us many lives and he still lives. Let’s tend to the wounded and get them some food.
SPCX2679*#*We need to send out search parties to find the Count. We don’t have many uninjured men left, but the Count has sustained some wounds too. If we get him soon enough, we might be able to get rid of him for good.
SPCX268*#*It’s time for yer first action. Ye see that Spanish galley to the east? That will be our target. If I got  the right information, she should be full of gold.
SPCX2680*#*Our ship is in a bad shape too. I never expected the Count to be so good at naval battles. It’s good to have you with me, captain. I hope you can help with repairing our ship.
SPCX2681*#*Don’t mind me, I am fine. It’s just a little blood. We need to search for the Count first. Send the men who have no serious injury ahead.
SPCX2682*#*The wound is bleeding profusely. We will have to go to the nearest town. I need a doctor and we can buy a new ship. This one won’t sail for much longer, even with the repairs done.
SPCX2683*#*Oh, so you found the missing guy. That’s great. But I would appreciate if you concentrate on our mission. I need more arrows for the crossbow. We will hardly get some silver here, so iron will have to do.
SPCX2684*#*Yes, I am fine now. The wound is stitched and should heal soon. We don’t have time to stay here longer than absolutely necessary. Get some supplies and we will eat on the ship.
SPCX2685*#*I don’t know where have all the stakes gone. Are you burning them as fuel for your steamships? Maybe someone is trying to sabotage us.
SPCX2686*#*We are already near the shores of England. I am afraid the fiend has already hidden in some dark hole there. It won’t be easy to find him now.
SPCX2687*#*Go ask the dockmaster if he saw anything suspicious. I hope he will not ask for more money. And take a stake in the case the fiend got to him first. You can never be too cautious.
SPCX2688*#*So he wants more money. I expected this. But my pockets are empty, captain. Are you sure he was not turned? Ok, we will have to pay him then.
SPCX2689*#*The dockmaster even gave you an address? That was worth the investment. Let’s gear up and pay the Count a surprise visit in his new home. If you ever thought about using armor, now is the time.
SPCX269*#*Got meself a new ship, she is a real beauty. Her name is Queen Ann’s Revenge. She got a bit scratched durin’ the fight. So let’s get her nice and shinin’ again.
SPCX2690*#*Do you see anything? It’s awfully dark in here. Light up a candle. Wait, I hear something…
SPCX2691*#*Such a pleasure to see another person on this seemingly endless sea. Well, apart from that misguided hunter who is following me. Care to join me for dinner?
SPCX2692*#*Tell me about yourself captain. What brings you here? Maybe we can help each other. I could use something to keep Mr. Van Helsing from my heels. I don’t want to hurt him, maybe just restrain him.
SPCX2693*#*I have lived for a long time in the Eastern part of the continent. I decided to relocate to England now. I tried to purchase a house there beforehand. Unfortunately, it did not go as planned.
SPCX2694*#*Yes, building my own house is a good option. Even though I prefer old buildings with some history a new house might suit me too. Now let’s make a toast to our cooperation.
SPCX2695*#*So you are looking for poor Jonathan. Yes, he visited me at my castle. We did not come to an understanding. He did not even manage to arrange the transport of these crates to England.
SPCX2696*#*You wonder what’s inside those casks, right? Feel free to open them. There is just some earth from my home. I have found it to be best for planting roses. Now please use some nails to close them again.
SPCX2697*#*You can deliver the crates to the shipping company that will take them to London. I need everything to be ready for my arrival. The garden too.
SPCX2698*#*Now let’s head for England. If you are hungry, you will have to catch some fish. I am afraid I don’t have any regular food on the ship.
SPCX2699*#*My devoted hunter is still on my trail. I have thought about making a surprise for him. Let’s ask some pirates to pay him a visit. I am sure they will have fun together and meanwhile, we can sail far away.
SPCX270*#*Me men are sick. Some rotten illness’s spreadin’. But we can’t get to the medicine because the rich folks keep it all to themselves. So we’re gonna kidnap some of them.
SPCX2700*#*I hope the deal with the pirates went well. If they made you some trouble, just tell me and I will take care of them. We can always find some new distraction for Mr. Van Helsing.
SPCX2701*#*Let’s continue to England now. How are the works on my house progressing? Can you send some materials ahead? I really want everything to be completed once I arrive.
SPCX2702*#*I would like my new house to remind me of my castle in Transylvania. So the inner walls need to be paneled by a dark oak wood. The best oaks grow in Romania so deliver the wood from there.
SPCX2703*#*The pirates ended up on the bottom of the sea but they kept Van Helsing off our backs. You are a reliable partner. As thanks, we can spare some time for a fine dinner for you and your men.
SPCX2704*#*You still worry about Jonathan? He left my mansion alive and healthy. He probably got lost. The woods of Transylvania are quite dark. The villagers will gladly help you find him in exchange for gold.
SPCX2705*#*But please captain, I still need you to accompany me to London. I am sure Jonathan will be just fine. The Transylvanians are kind and welcoming people. Just send a few of your men to find him.
SPCX2706*#*I am tired of always sleeping on the ship. The sunlight is leaking through the boards. Let’s take a rest on this island and find a nice cave for me. Then close it up with some rocks. I need a good day’s sleep.
SPCX2707*#*Van Helsing is again on our trail. You wonder how I know this? I have eyes in the sky. Especially at night. Anyway, my winged friends are getting hungry. I have already fed them all rats that were on the ship.
SPCX2708*#*That man won’t ever give up. I may have to take care of him myself. I am done playing nice.
SPCX2709*#*Maybe you wonder why I did not make you one of mine. You get stronger but it comes with a few weaknesses too. And it’s good to have a loyal human and a captain on your side. Cheers to that!
SPCX271*#*If they wanna get back their people they have to give us the medicine. We ain’t gonna hurt them and we can’t let them starve either. But they better give us the pills.
SPCX2710*#*Don’t worry, working with me will be definitely worth your time. Now help me prepare the ship for the fight. Van Helsing has caught up with us again. Let’s get rid of that annoying man for good.
SPCX2711*#*I will wait for Van Helsing on the ship. You sail around him from the back and surprise him with cannon fire. If he is such a passionate hunter, he may go hunt for fish at the bottom of the sea.
SPCX2712*#*It’s unfortunate that we have to fight by day, but the sun is hidden under thick clouds. This will be to our advantage. Still, I would prefer to stay below decks. Let’s loose up some planks make him fall to me.
SPCX2713*#*You do not need to kill them all. If you stumble upon survivors, offer them gold. All men desire gold and are ready to sell their soul for it.
SPCX2714*#*The hunter jumped overboard and hid underwater when I was going to sink my teeth into him. Now tend to your wounds. Burn that out with some hot iron, before it gets inflamed.
SPCX2715*#*How are you feeling, captain? Don’t worry, I won’t let my allies die so easily. I am glad you are feeling better. I believe we got rid of Van Helsing for some time. Now eat something so you will get stronger.
SPCX2716*#*Now we can look for your friend, Jonathan. My bats have learned that he is on a ship sailing for England already. You see, he is fine. You can send your men to meet him.
SPCX2717*#*I trust you are feeling better now. If you can get back to your work, I would appreciate something to sate my hunger. The fight had cost me a lot of energy.
SPCX2718*#*I think we can allow ourselves some peaceful rest on the shore. I truly don’t enjoy sleeping on that rocking vessel. I will be fine with a dark cellar or a cave if we find nothing else.
SPCX2719*#*Did you meet Jonathan? You see, he is fine. You can trust me. He was my real estate agent, why would I hurt him? I guess you have his job now. So go check up on my house and pay out the workers.
SPCX272*#*Arr good, good. We have the  medicine, so let’s get the scallywags back to work. No excuses of sickness will do now. I expect a nice pile of gold from ye.
SPCX2720*#*So my mansion in London is ready. That is good to hear because we will be arriving shortly. Make sure there is a carriage waiting for me at the pier at midnight.
SPCX2721*#*I want no people around the house after I arrive. Put up a fence around it or something. I value my privacy highly.
SPCX2722*#*Have one last drink with me on the ship. It was a real pleasure sailing with you, captain. Even with Van Helsing on our heels.
SPCX2723*#*I like the house. You did a good job arranging it. The only thing that is not perfect is the cellar. Maybe I have not mentioned how important this part of the house is for me.
SPCX2724*#*Van Helsing has arrived in London. So he is still alive and annoying as always. As I know him, he will surely track me down. Let’s have him followed for now.
SPCX2725*#*He paid the dockmaster to find out where my house is. I guess we need to expect visitors soon. I should go prepare myself.
SPCX2726*#*No knocking, no greeting,... he will learn to be a better guest next time. Well, there won’t be a next time for him.
SPCX2727*#*Could you take me to England by any chance? I was on a ship heading to London, but she unexpectedly malfunctioned. She will have to be repaired and who knows how long that will take.
SPCX2728*#*If you have no place on your ship, I will understand. Maybe you could try to help repair the problem on my ship. As I understand, the steam engine is not working.
SPCX2729*#*Oh, so you can take me on your ship? That’s great! My fiance must be already worried to death. I should have been home a long time ago. I just need a little food and nothing else.
SPCX273*#*Rumours of a royal pardon for all pirates have gotten to me. It could be a good deal for an old seadog like me. Let’s send one of me scallywags thar first and we’ll see.
SPCX2730*#*I am Jonathan Harker, a solicitor from London. I will join you in a moment. Let me just check how I look. I haven’t had the chance to see myself in a mirror since I left that terrible place.
SPCX2731*#*I was going to meet a client in Eastern Europe but I never would have guessed what horrors were waiting there for me. I am glad I escaped with my life. Everything else I left there.
SPCX2732*#*I promise, once we arrive in England, I will pay you for the voyage. And I will add a tip for free. The cargo from my original ship needs to be in England soon. They will pay you well for delivering it.
SPCX2733*#*I told you it was a good deal. Send your sailors for the cargo and let’s hurry to England. My sweet Mina is already waiting for me.
SPCX2734*#*You are curious about what happened to me, I can tell. But I am afraid you would not believe me even if I told you. I need a drink before I venture into this dark story.
SPCX2735*#*I see you guessed the contents of my story. But how could it be? Did you experience something similar? By the way, I hope there is tomato juice inside this drink.
SPCX2736*#*I escaped that cursed castle only with lady luck by my side. I never carried weapons with me but now I see how that could be useful. But who knows if weapons can even hurt such monsters.
SPCX2737*#*Will you stay here for some time? I will be back as quickly as I can with the money for you. You can do some business in the city while you wait. The fish are always in demand.
SPCX2738*#*I can’t believe this. I saw that monster here in London. How can it be? My Mina is here, what if something happens to her with that monster around. Let’s find someone who can help us.
SPCX2739*#*Mr. Van Helsing will help us? Did he give you some advice on how to defend ourselves against that monster? I must have a way to protect Mina.
SPCX274*#*It went well. They pardoned him and let him go. It ain’t a trap. I would like to rest me weary bones in some small calm village. I will take that pardon for meself too.
SPCX2740*#*I feel safer now. Still, I hope Mr. Van Helsing will take care of it. I am no fighter, just a simple clerk. Can you send some men to watch our house?
SPCX2741*#*Is the monster gone? You know what is the worst? He could have infected countless others by now. His minions could be outside our windows right now. We need big walls around the house.
SPCX2742*#*Mina’s best friend, Lucy, is dead. There were bite marks on her neck. This was Count Dracula, no doubt. Van Helsing must have failed. We need to prepare for the worst.
SPCX2743*#*I have made some research, captain. We need to get two special knives. One will go into his heart and the other across his neck. But we must do this before sunset to get rid of the monster.
SPCX2744*#*Here is a list of things we could use in our fight. I will leave the shopping to you. In the meantime, I will find the creature’s hiding place.
SPCX2745*#*I am just a clerk and you are just a captain, but together we can do this. And we still have your fearless crew. We will save Mina and the whole city!
SPCX2746*#*We did it, captain! Dracula is dead and now we can live without fear. Let’s celebrate this properly. I feel like having a proper bloody steak or maybe some sushi. How about you?
SPCX2747*#*A new challenge is here! Prove your skills as a capable captain and owner of a large merchant fleet by delivering loads of cargo. If you can make it, great rewards will be yours.
SPCX2748*#*How are you doing, captain? Have you been taking care of my port? Well, it’s your port now, I guess. Let’s have some warm fish soup and talk about the old times when you arrived here.
SPCX2749*#*You are probably asking why I have come to visit you again? Just look at my hat. We are celebrating the third birthday of our wonderful port! Now go buy yourself such a hat too.
SPCX275*#*I will build meself a nice comfortable home here on the islands. No need for a stone mansion, wooden villa will do just fine.
SPCX2750*#*You might not have been here for so long but I remember the humble beginnings. We had to start from scratch building the first house and the first ship from scraps of wood.
SPCX2751*#*I can see you have moved on and your port has become a great modern town. Don’t forget to upgrade your port continually. Progress is everything in the marine business and everywhere else too.
SPCX2752*#*So let’s prepare the Seaport birthday party. Bring balloons and party hats. It will be in a few days. You and all your sailors are invited.
SPCX2753*#*There is a fantastic birthday present waiting for you. But that’s not all. I will keep it a secret for now. Let me just say you will need a lot of materials for new ships, captain.
SPCX2754*#*What would be a birthday party without some tasty snacks? How about peanuts? Everyone loves the salty crunchy nuts and I am no exception.
SPCX2755*#*Something more filling should be on the tables too. For a Seaport party, it should be some seafood. And show me a sailor who does not like fish.
SPCX2756*#*I think the best place for the party is the Town Hall. But is it large enough? How about you upgrade her once more. Just to be sure we all will fit in.
SPCX2757*#*The Town Hall is ready for the celebration. We just need something to drink and then we can celebrate. So let’s go buy some drinks for the party.
SPCX2758*#*It’s time I told you about the surprise. You have a magnificent fleet but the technological progress is going further. I have arranged a visit by Mr. Rudolf Diesel. He will help you make some great ships.
SPCX2759*#*Mr. Diesel has made a revolution in the industry. He has constructed a motor run by oil. It’s much more powerful than a steam engine. We must get this invention for our port!
SPCX276*#*Arrr layin on me ass ain’t nothin’ for a pirate like me. Let’s get back to me favourite trade and steal some gold. A new hat to signify the new beginning would be nice.
SPCX2760*#*The motor ships are going to make our work so much easier. We just need to gain knowledge from Mr. Diesel and start constructing new vessels. Let me speak to your sailors to prepare them for this too.
SPCX2761*#*Let’s prepare some food for our guest. We want him to feel welcome in our port. Well, technically it’s your port now and I am a guest now too. So I might just eat some of that food too.
SPCX2762*#*Mr. Diesel will need a workshop where he can do his magic. Let’s build it now so he can get to work as soon as he arrives.
SPCX2763*#*I have acquired some secret information. It seems Mr. Diesel loves peanuts. He has ordered like tons of them. Maybe he is secretly keeping an elephant but I doubt that.
SPCX2764*#*I hope everything is ready because our guest will arrive tomorrow. We should have some finances at hand in case he needs something for his research.
SPCX2765*#*I am sure you can handle the cooperation with Mr. Diesel on your own. You are the captain and master of the port after all. I will just jump on my boat and go as soon as she is repaired.
SPCX2766*#*My boat is ready to take me back home. And the future is already knocking on your door. Or maybe it’s just Mr. Diesel. I can’t wait to see the first motor ship in your fleet.
SPCX2767*#*See you later, captain! And just in case, bring more peanuts. I want Mr. Diesel to feel like at home.
SPCX2768*#*I received an invitation to visit your port. I love traveling by ships so it will be a pleasure to work with you. Have you already started amassing the materials?
SPCX2769*#*The voyage was quite long and I have grown really hungry. There was not much fresh food on the ship. Before we get to work, let’s get something tasty to eat.
SPCX277*#*Look who came to visit me! My fellow pirate and friend, captain Charles Vane. He must have worried about me retirement. This calls for a party with lots of food and rum.
SPCX2770*#*I will need some things from my laboratory at home. Can we send your sailors for them? Meanwhile, we can start talking about the project.
SPCX2771*#*Your men did a good job. Now I have everything I need to start work. I would give them some gold as a reward for being so swift, alas I have my pockets empty.
SPCX2772*#*Currently, the diesel engine is just a prototype. We must be prepared for some failures. I will build a new one from scratch and try to avoid the previous shortcomings.
SPCX2773*#*Do we have some secure space where we can experiment? In case of a failure, the engine could explode. That house will do, but we should put some warning signs outside.
SPCX2774*#*Anyway, why do you have so many peanuts here? One would think you have an army of elephants in your port. Actually, I might have a use for them! For the peanuts, not for the elephants.
SPCX2775*#*Peanut oil or any other vegetable oil is a perfect fuel for my engine. However, I am afraid it won’t be efficient for mass production. But we will solve that later. Let’s buy us some more oil.
SPCX2776*#*I don’t want you to go running around too much when I need you here to assist me. So bring in some food in advance. We can store it in another one of my inventions, the refrigerating box.
SPCX2777*#*While you were gone, there was an accident. Thankfully, I was out too or it might have ended badly for me. But the house is quite a mess.
SPCX2778*#*With your sailors' help, we will be done with the rebuilding sooner. I know now where the problem was. I might have used too much oil. Let’s be more careful in the future.
SPCX2779*#*This new engine is going to work and it will be perfect for a ship. You construct the ship and I the engine. I would advise making the hull from metal in case of accidental explosions.
SPCX278*#*Ha! I have heard about a captain who is lookin’ to capture me. Foolish dog! He will never succeed! Get some cutlasses and pistols so we can give him a proper welcome.
SPCX2780*#*The ship looks great. And the engine is ready too. Now we just need to install it. I will take care of that. You make sure there is a dock large enough in your port for this new vessel.
SPCX2781*#*We need more fuel for the ship. I used the oil we had to fry fish when I was hungry. I am sure you can get us more, right?
SPCX2782*#*Actually, the fish tasted great. So if we could get more, that would be fantastic.
SPCX2783*#*Well, look at her! No sails or steam and yet she is so fast. But a new technology is not cheap. I had to invest some of my own money to construct the parts.
SPCX2784*#*Let’s show your crew how to take care of a motor ship. It’s nothing complicated, but there are a few differences to sailing vessels or steamboats.
SPCX2785*#*A Motor ship will be able to carry much more cargo than a steamer. Oil is much more space efficient than coal. You better prepare your warehouses for the change.
SPCX2786*#*At first, I advise taking some spare parts with you on the voyages. The ship version of the motor is not completely failproof yet. Let’s go to the Hardware Store, I will tell you what you need.
SPCX2787*#*I am sure that in time we will come up with a better alternative to the peanut oil. But for now, let’s buy a few gallons. This was the first fuel I used for my prototype as well.
SPCX2788*#*The ship is working fine but my work here is still not done. I have to give you my know-how and then we can talk about the business part of our deal. But first, let’s have a look at your fleet.
SPCX2789*#*It is a great fleet but with the motor ships, it will be even better. Of course, you will need some experience to use the motor ships. Until then just keep on trading and fishing.
SPCX279*#*Our dear captain feeds the fish at the bottom of the sea. And what do ye know? I made a real pirate out of ye. All ye need now are some pirate accessories and we are done.
SPCX2790*#*The patent for the diesel engine will cost you some money. I like you, captain, but you must understand this is a serious business. I can’t just give away things for free.
SPCX2791*#*Maybe sometime in the future, there will be ships which can sail without sailors. But now we still need a good crew to manage the ship. Make sure you explain the new things to them.
SPCX2792*#*Now let’s go have a look at your docks. I know you have already made some adjustments but the motor ships will take up much more space in your fleet than your current vessels.
SPCX2793*#*If you still have some peanuts in your warehouse we can produce oil from them. It’s good to have some fuel in reserve and you can even use it for cooking.
SPCX2794*#*Look here, these are the plans for my earlier invention, the refrigerating machine. It can be a useful thing even on a ship. You will need some metal to build it.
SPCX2795*#*Now my work here is done. Your port is ready for the technological revolution. Help me pack my things, I need all the equipment delivered back into my lab at home.
SPCX2796*#*I have just one more request for you. Please deliver a letter to my wife in Munich. I will take a ship home but I guess your sailors can deliver it sooner than I arrive.
SPCX2797*#*It was a pleasure, captain. You have a beautiful port and fleet. With my new technology, it will become even better. We will probably never see each other again, so take care.
SPCX2798*#*Good sir or mam’ do you want to buy some matches? It’s just a few coins.
SPCX2799*#*I am so sorry. Don’t worry I ain’t sick. It’s just the cold wind. Here are your matches. These are the last ones. It will be hard to earn some gold now.
SPCX280*#*What are ye still doin’ here? I have taught ye all I know about piracy. Leave me the wooden leg, ye don’t need it yet. And now go bother someone else.
SPCX2800*#*I could help you find some goods you need. What are you looking for? There is a great blacksmith in the port and also a stonemason. I can show you the way.
SPCX2801*#*You know already, right? I don’t have a real home or parents. I usually sleep in the alley behind the inn. The wall there is warm from the kitchen. But it’s getting really moldy of late.
SPCX2802*#*My uncle told me my parents left on a ship called Snowball. But then he died and they never returned. Maybe you could ask the sailors at the Inn about the ship. They did not want to talk to me.
SPCX2803*#*Did you find out something? So the ship sailed to America. I heard some of the sailors talking about that country. Do you know where it is? Is it far? Sneeze!
SPCX2804*#*I don’t want to go to a hospital. Please! I need to find a ship which will take me to America. I must find my parents! Will you help me?
SPCX2805*#*Let’s go to this fishing vessel. My dad is a fisherman, maybe they know something about him. And you can get some fish from them too. Fresh fish are tasty.
SPCX2806*#*I learned something! A ship with the name Snowball is docked on the southern pier. Let’s go there right now! If you have some business I can go alone. You don’t have to send your sailors with me.
SPCX2807*#*You are back! But the ship...she looks like a wreck. And there is no one there. What will we do now?
SPCX2808*#*Are you going to repair the ship and sail with her to America? I can go with you, right? I can help with a lot of things. I promise.
SPCX2809*#*Where are the scarves you ask? I had to give it to the other kids living on the street. I am going to America now. So I won’t need them, right? It's really hot there, right?
SPCX281*#*Ahoy, my name is Bartholomew. If that’s too long for ye, just call me Black Bart. So now show me that ye can get some gold together and then we can talk.
SPCX2810*#*It would be like the bestest present for Christmas to find Mum and Dad. I am sure they must miss me. Wait! I must take my matchstick figures with me. I made some when I could not sell any matches.
SPCX2811*#*We can’t sail on Snowball to America? But promise to repair her later. I can help. I will find you some nails in the port. Big people miss such small things easily.
SPCX2812*#*Finding nails is a hard work. And my belly is rumbling. Are we going yet? I want to be in America soon.
SPCX2813*#*I never had so much food in my life. Thank you so much. Wow, that’s a big ship! Is it your’s? Are we going to sail on her? There are so many people!
SPCX2814*#*The wind here is really cold. Are your sailors not cold? Don’t they want such a pretty scarf like me?
SPCX2815*#*I love this scarf. I can wrap it about my feet once the snow falls. Oh! I have shoes, of course. I just forgot to put them on. No, you don’t need to buy me new shoes.
SPCX2816*#*I am feeling so much better now. I am warm and not sick at all. Anyway, there was a man looking for you. He was saying something about a stone delivery. But I forgot his name.
SPCX2817*#*I met a nice lady at the canteen today. She gave me a candy cane. I never tasted something so good. Can I get some more of those?
SPCX2818*#*The sea is so big. It’s a bit scary but I like it. Can we go out on the water in one of the small boats? But there is only two of them. Shouldn’t there be more like on the other ships?
SPCX2819*#*My tummy is hurting. May I have something to eat? Or maybe I had too much of the candy canes.
SPCX282*#*Blackbeard told me about ye. Says yer a good pirate. That I can trust ye. But I will be checking that for meself. Some precious stones can always win my favour.
SPCX2820*#*Clara told me we can decorate a Christmas tree together. Clara is the lady from the canteen. But there are no trees on the ship. What will we do?
SPCX2821*#*Hmm, this does not look like a proper tree. If we use some green tablecloth it will do. But what about the ornaments? There is a man on the ship who makes pretty things of glass. He could sell us some.
SPCX2822*#*And we can use the candy canes too. They are so pretty with white and red stripes and perfect for hanging on the tree. But I ate them all already.
SPCX2823*#*The tree is beautiful! I remember we used to have a Christmas tree with mum and dad. But it did not have so many ornaments like this one. Isn’t it a bit askew? Maybe we should nail it down.
SPCX2824*#*How will we find mum and dad once we get to America? We will have to ask a lot of people about them. Maybe the sailors can help us. If there are more of us, we will find them sooner.
SPCX2825*#*Dad is a fisherman so he could work on one of your ships. You have also fishing ships, right? I know a bit about fish too. I also helped mum cook them and I collected their scales.
SPCX2826*#*Dad will catch some fish for you and mum can cook and I will help too. Then you will help us build a house, right? A big one, of stone, with a large fireplace.
SPCX2827*#*And then we can have Christmas in our home. You and Clara can come too. I just hope we will find them soon. I will give them the Candy Canes as presents. I am sure mum and dad will love them too.
SPCX2828*#*Look, it’s snowing! Now that I get wrapped in the warm scarf, it's really pretty. Before I did not like it at all. I always watched other kids having fun in the snow on sleds. I want to do that too.
SPCX2829*#*Do you think they are ok? My mum and dad? Why did they not come back for me? What was that sound? The ship is creaking strangely. We are not going to sink, are we?
SPCX283*#*It’s time to upgrade our weapons. You can’t capture a ship with cutlass and pistols alone. I have already taken care of the cannons. All we need now is the ammo.
SPCX2830*#*I am glad the ship is fine and we can get to America safely. But mum and dad will be sad to see me like this. In old dirty clothes. But I don’t have any money for a new skirt and coat.
SPCX2831*#*With that money, you could buy clothes for the whole town! I will make sure to buy you a Christmas present from it. I don’t need a gift. I will be happy with a single candy cane under the Christmas tree.
SPCX2832*#*Look what Clara gave me! It’s a bear with a hat. He is so soft! Can I make a house for him? You have so many crates on the ship. One would be enough for him.
SPCX2833*#*I never had such a soft and pretty toy. I love him! I will call him Mr. Snowflake. I want to have many many more bears like Mr. Snowflake so he will never be lonely like I was.
SPCX2834*#*Do you have any more candy canes? I am hungry. And Mr. Snowflake would like something tasty too.
SPCX2835*#*There! I can see a big stone lady before us. Is it a giant? Oh, it’s a statue. Are we already in America? Then let’s tell the sailors to look for my parents.
SPCX2836*#*Everything is so large here. Can we go look for my parents now? What? Do you have to work? Right now? But promise me we will go after that.
SPCX2837*#*Can we go now? Where do you think they could be? Maybe in the tavern? Or in the guesthouse? Let’s go there first!
SPCX2838*#*It seems they did not go to the tavern or the guesthouse. Nobody knew anything about them. Hmm, we could go ask the fishermen in the port. My dad may have looked for work there.
SPCX2839*#*Where can they just be? Nobody has seen them. And I left Mr. Snowflake on the ship too. He must be so lonely. Do you think somebody found him?
SPCX284*#*Now that ye look acceptable we can get down to business. Pirate trade is no walk in the park. To be successful ye have to plan your actions. Let’s do that over a dinner.
SPCX2840*#*Why does no one know anything about mum and dad? What will we do now? Do you think something has happened to them?
SPCX2841*#*Let’s go visit Clara. Maybe she can help us. You can also talk to her about your project. Are you building a big house?
SPCX2842*#*I have never been in such a beautiful home. It’s all so pretty. And there is even a room full of teddy bears. It’s Mr. Snowflakes family! Do you think I can stay here for now?
SPCX2843*#*Grandma has baked a cake. It’s so good, captain! You have to try it! And we are going to have a Christmas dinner tonight! And there is a tree too!
SPCX2844*#*I know the liner SS Santa Maria is fully booked but please can you still take me aboard? I must make it home for Christmas. I can’t leave my mother home alone during this time.
SPCX2845*#*There is no other ship heading to New York before Christmas. I can sleep in the cargo hold if there is no other place. Even if it would mean sleeping on a marble block, I don’t mind.
SPCX2846*#*Oh, I must have forgotten my coat on the pier. It was really warm around noon but now the wind is chilly. But I don’t want to bother you with my problems. I am sorry.
SPCX2847*#*You are so kind. Please, let me offer you my assistance too. I am a nurse so I can help the sailors or the passengers should they suffer from any ailments. Just send them to me.
SPCX2848*#*I am so glad you found a place for me on the ship. If you want I will check your ship’s medical supplies and tell you what needs to be replaced or purchased anew.
SPCX2849*#*Now you can be sure your passengers and crew will arrive in good health. Of course, taking care of the ship and the voyage is your job. But I will do whatever I can to help.
SPCX285*#*There is a big fleet of Portuguese ships not far. They must be carrying something precious. This is our chance, but more men will be necessary.
SPCX2850*#*A man has slipped on a wet floor in the canteen. I will need a crutch for him and you should place some warning signs around the wet floor. It will prevent similar accidents.
SPCX2851*#*I have not bought any presents for my Mother. She always says she doesn’t need anything, but still… Even something simple like a scarf would make her happy, I am sure.
SPCX2852*#*The right diet is essential for good health. I understand it’s hard to keep fresh vegetables and fruits on such a long voyage. But there should be no shortage of fresh fish.
SPCX2853*#*Actually, I might need your help even after the end of the voyage. I am going to establish the Red Cross in the United States. I may need a reliable supplier to build the headquarters.
SPCX2854*#*Red Cross is an organization helping people in need. I have been in Geneva to talk to the founder, Mr. Dunant. We are depending mainly on volunteers and donations. So your contribution would be welcome.
SPCX2855*#*I met a young girl today. She was alone so it seemed strange to me. But she told me she is here with the captain. Do you know her? She seemed so lonely, I will give her some sweets next time I meet her.
SPCX2856*#*I want to make a Christmas tree with little Eva. She must be bored here, poor thing, all alone among the adults. Can you think of something we could use as a tree?
SPCX2857*#*Well, these planks were trees a long time ago but I guess it will do. With a saw and a few nails, I can make a tree out of this. It’s not just healthcare I am good at, I can use a hammer if needed.
SPCX2858*#*There is a fight on the main deck. Please send your sailors there to calm the men down before anybody gets hurt. They probably had too much to drink.
SPCX2859*#*Maybe some sweets would bring back the Christmas atmosphere to the ship once again. Meanwhile, I will be taking care of the fools who were fighting. They have some bruises.
SPCX286*#*Raise the Portuguese flag so we can enter the fleet inconspicuously. And don’t forget the ladders and ropes, we will need them to board the ships.
SPCX2860*#*Captain, can I speak with you? It’s about Eva. She thinks that you will find her parents in America. I guess you know that is not very likely. What will happen to her then? She will need a home.
SPCX2861*#*Not just a building of bricks. She needs a family. I can see you like her but your job requires you to be at sea. That is no place for a child. Maybe one of your sailors has a family which could take her in.
SPCX2862*#*I worry about her. Like this, she will end up in an orphanage. It will be better than on the street but she won’t be happy there. I will at least pack her some candy canes as a present, she loves them so much.
SPCX2863*#*I would take her in myself but I don’t have a husband. I live only with my mother. I don’t know if that would be a good family for a young girl. For now, I will make sure she eats something else than candy too.
SPCX2864*#*The winter is here. This time is always hard on the people without a home. I hope the Red Cross will be able to help them a bit. I can count on your cooperation in this matter, right?
SPCX2865*#*I met a gentleman who owns an older building in Washington. He offered to sell it to me as the headquarters for the Red Cross. But I still think it might be better to build a new house. What do you think?
SPCX2866*#*You are right, a new building might be better after all. I hope you will take care of the material delivery.
SPCX2867*#*I saw Eva eating one of those Candy Canes again. So many sweets can be bad for her health. Do you have something else that might get her attention instead?
SPCX2868*#*This voyage is slowly nearing its end. We should be in New York soon. I hope you will continue working with me on the Red Cross branch. Maybe some of your sailors would be interested in helping too.
SPCX2869*#*I am going to pack up my things and get ready to disembark. Maybe you should take a look at the cargo. I heard some men talking about a broken container.
SPCX287*#*Arr we have our cargo hold full of fish, no place for the treasure. My men like to fish in their spare time, it's relaxing. I will sell the fish to you for a good price.
SPCX2870*#*I see that Eva loves the teddy bear. Maybe we could make a nice present for each child on the ship. Wouldn’t it be a nice touch at the end of the voyage?
SPCX2871*#*Actually, I am sad to finish this voyage and say farewell to Eva. I would have loved spending the Christmas with her. Maybe we can at least have a last brunch together.
SPCX2872*#*Thank you for the pleasant voyage, captain. I am going home now, my mother is already waiting for me. But I will contact you soon about our next business.
SPCX2873*#*I told my mother about Eva. She insisted that we should take her in. Do you think Eva would like that? Until she finds her parents, she could stay with us. I can prepare a room for her.
SPCX2874*#*I still have to think about my work. I am going to check the land for sale where we could build the headquarters. I will let you know when I find something. Then you can start delivering the materials.
SPCX2875*#*Did you have any luck with finding Eva’s parents yet? Not even a hint of what could have happened to them? Poor girl, she must be sad. Come and dine with us this evening and bring Eva too.
SPCX2876*#*Mother is already baking a cake for Eva. I should go and buy some groceries for dinner. Since we are going to the market, we can also take care of the things we need for the headquarters.
SPCX2877*#*Anyway, the construction of the Red Cross headquarters is going well. I have already recruited a few nurses and doctors for our cause. Next, we should get some medical equipment.
SPCX2878*#*Eva is really happy about her room. She even suggested herself she will stay with us. I am glad. I will continue looking for her parents in the meantime. If you are not too busy, you can help me too.
SPCX2879*#*Merry Christmas, captain. I have a small present for you too. For all the help you have given me and Eva. We are both very grateful. Now come to the Christmas table.
SPCX288*#*We got into the midst of the fleet without raising alarm. Now let’s board the nearest ship and ask about the treasure. The captain will surely know about it.
SPCX2880*#*So you are the captain that is going to help us construct the first commercial motor ship? I am the lead engineer of the project. Let’s go for a cup of coffee before we get to work.
SPCX2881*#*Our company, B&W, has been building ships for a long time. But using the new diesel engine as propulsion has been my idea. We will need to experiment with different materials first.
SPCX2882*#*We have built a lot of steamships. So I will start with the construction based on a steamboat first. The modern steamers are constructed mainly from iron, so we will work with that.
SPCX2883*#*Apart from helping me with the construction, I will also need your assistance with handling the delivery of the food supplies to our factory. Our last supplier went bankrupt a week ago.
SPCX2884*#*Can I see your fleet and maybe have a word with your crew? I like to know the people I am doing business with. And I always get the best ideas by talking with others.
SPCX2885*#*After having a word with your crew I got a great idea for a ship design. I must make a model before I forget the details. Quick, get me some material I can use!
SPCX2886*#*This model shows the main parts of the ship. But the most important part, her heart, is the engine which will run on fuel made from oil. Let’s get some in advance, we will need a lot of it for the test runs.
SPCX2887*#*Before we can even start the work we need to buy the design for the diesel motor. I like to arrange my business personally so let’s go to Germany and visit Mr. Diesel.
SPCX2888*#*The B&W has a sister company in Germany. Since we are already going there, we can take care of the next shipment of goods to our subsidiary. I am sure your fleet can handle it.
SPCX2889*#*I have arranged a meeting with Mr. Diesel for tomorrow. Today we can check the local market. Maybe there will be some things we can use for our motor ship.
SPCX289*#*Great! The captain told us where to go. Now tie them up and we go for our treasure. Leave them some food so they don’t die of hunger. I can be nice sometimes too.
SPCX2890*#*The deal is sealed. I have obtained the rights for the diesel engine for my company. Now nothing stands in our way of constructing the first motor ship. Let’s go back on one of your ships and get to work.
SPCX2891*#*I might have jinxed it by being so enthusiastic. The factory workers are on a strike. We need them at work now. Let’s give them some free lunches and hope they will calm down.
SPCX2892*#*The free food worked for now, but I think this situation is not completely resolved yet. Let’s start the work on the ship before they go on strike again.
SPCX2893*#*I need to make some experiments with the basic engine before I can design one to be used in a ship. I will need some fuel for that. It’s highly flammable, so please handle it with care.
SPCX2894*#*You are a good business partner so I decided to offer you a partnership on the project. It will require some financial investment at first, but it’s guaranteed to pay back in time.
SPCX2895*#*I have made some designs about how to incorporate the diesel engine into the ship. We will make a few changes to the typical steamship design. For example, she won’t have a funnel.
SPCX2896*#*We don’t need to make the prototype too big. It will serve for testing purposes mainly, so let’s finish the hull and decks with some cheaper material.
SPCX2897*#*Let’s concentrate on the engine now. I need you here, captain, so leave your fleet in care of your sailors. I am sure they will handle it fine for a while.
SPCX2898*#*The ship is ready, now we just need to install the engine and get ready for the first test on the water. Please, prepare the dock for our newest ship.
SPCX2899*#*Well, the motor died after a few minutes. I will need to make some tweaks here and there. Just leave it to me and you handle the delivery of food for our employees. We need to keep their bellies full.
SPCX290*#*I would prefer a quiet approach. But ye never know what can happen. We need to be ready for an explosive situation.
SPCX2900*#*The design of the ship is good. I need to concentrate on the diesel engine now. We will have to make more test runs and that means we will need more fuel.
SPCX2901*#*The engine is working. And we have already received the first order for the diesel motors from a carriage factory. I must personally oversee the construction of the engines and you can deliver the materials.
SPCX2902*#*We can’t afford any complications while we are working on an order from a customer. So let’s get the workers a bonus so they will be content and concentrate on work.
SPCX2903*#*The engines are ready for transport to our client. But first, let’s make sure they will endure the voyage without any harm. We will need a solid crate for each engine.
SPCX2904*#*The first delivery of diesel motors made by our company was a success. The client is happy and I am sure we can expect more orders soon. We are making a little celebration at the company, call your crew too.
SPCX2905*#*Let’s get back to business! We got a contract for our first motor ship, and it may very well be the first seaworthy motor ship in the world. So let’s get to work!
SPCX2906*#*The East Asiatic Company ordered a large passenger-cargo ship with a diesel engine. The consumption of fuel will be huge even for the test runs. Let’s buy some oil first, before the price rises.
SPCX2907*#*We have an unrelated issue. One of the fishing vessels we made has malfunctioned. I promised the client to send him some help, while we fix the problem. You do have some fishing vessels, right?
SPCX2908*#*While you were away fishing, the works on the motor ship have progressed well. We are already ahead of schedule. The only problem is that we will soon run out of construction materials.
SPCX2909*#*We have had some troubles at the factory today. I think our workers need to be schooled properly in the construction of the new engine. It won’t be cheap, but it is necessary.
SPCX291*#*Ha! The fools! They stood no chance. We boarded their ship without any casualties. And there is so much loot we can hardly carry it all away. Better get some more men.
SPCX2910*#*The motor ship will be able to sail with a smaller crew than an average steamship. However, the sailors will have to be schooled in how to handle the new equipment. How about a short course for the men?
SPCX2911*#*The ship will serve both as a cargo transport and as a passenger liner. So we will need to make some pretty cabins for the passengers and a large enough cargo hold.
SPCX2912*#*The ship needs to be properly balanced so that when she is fully loaded she won’t lean to a side. We must be prepared for a heavy cargo like marble or bricks.
SPCX2913*#*I promised to the client that we will take care of the fuel for the maiden voyage as a form of discount for the ship. She was not cheap, I will tell you. So let’s get that oil processed.
SPCX2914*#*I received a word from my friend who owns the canning factory. They just lost a few ships during a storm. Since you are such a great fisherman, you could help supply them with fresh fish.
SPCX2915*#*The fish have left an unpleasant smell in the cargo hold of your ships. We need a bunch of men to clean it up down there before we use the ships to deliver more material for the motor ship.
SPCX2916*#*Now we can finish the captain’s cabin and the main deck. We will need some more metal for that.
SPCX2917*#*I have just got the message from the client. He has chosen a name for the ship. She will be called Selandia. Let’s buy some paint to make her pretty and write her name on the hull.
SPCX2918*#*She looks perfect inside and out. We are ready for launch. There are still some details that will need to be completed later. But we can prepare the launching track and get her on the water.
SPCX2919*#*The ship is with her new owners and is getting ready for her maiden voyage to Bangkok. I have been invited aboard for the voyage. Have you ever been to Thailand?
SPCX292*#*Place the jewels and coins inside wooden crates. We don’t need anyone seeing our precious cargo.
SPCX2920*#*You remember that special discount I promised our client? I did not expect the maiden voyage to be so long. We will need more fuel to cover the whole voyage.
SPCX2921*#*We have oil for the engine and now we need only food for the people. Then we can head out into the sea. The first stop will be in London.
SPCX2922*#*British Prime Minister Churchill will be visiting Selandia in London. Warn the men to be ready. Everything must be perfect. This is a chance to gain new customers from England.
SPCX2923*#*Mr. Churchill was impressed with our ship. This promises a good future for us. Now we are full of passengers but we have still a cargo of iron to pick up at Antwerp. So let’s get going.
SPCX2924*#*The docking fee in Antwerp is horrendous. But everyone wanted to see the ship that does not smoke. We have got the people’s attention for sure. And the investment will pay back in no time.
SPCX2925*#*Selandia is far more fuel efficient than the steamships and she can be operated with a much smaller crew too. That means we have more space for some additional cargo.
SPCX2926*#*The East Asiatic Company already ordered a sister ship for Selandia. I promised them the same deal as before, fuel for the maiden voyage for free.
SPCX2927*#*We can start looking around for the materials for Jutlandia, Selandia’s sister ship. In Europe everything is too expensive, we can get the materials in Asia much cheaper. Let’s make use of that.
SPCX2928*#*There is no stop planned until we arrive in Bangkok. Let’s talk to the quartermaster and see if they have enough supplies for the voyage. We can always help them out a bit.
SPCX2929*#*We have successfully arrived in Bangkok and the ship has proven herself. Let me thank you and all of your sailors too. Thanks to you we will be able to construct many motor ships in the future.
SPCX293*#*Wonderful! We will go to the town to sell the jewels and coins before they catch on to us. Give me your part of the treasure too, I will bring ye a profit much bigger.
SPCX2930*#*Could you help me with the bags? I have bought too much groceries, they are heavy like stones.
SPCX2931*#*I forgot the fish! And that’s why I went to the port in the first place. Could you go and get some for me, dear?
SPCX2932*#*These look perfect. I will just go buy some sweets for the Christmas tree and then you can accompany me home. I hope you don’t mind helping an old woman a while longer.
SPCX2933*#*You are such a sweetheart. Please stay for dinner. I will bake the fish you got for me. And I have a freshly made apple pie too. Now sit down. If you are cold, there should be some wood for the fireplace.
SPCX2934*#*Now, I hope the food was to your liking. I really don’t want to bother you anymore. But my roof is leaking. My daughter promised to find someone to repair it, but she is away now.
SPCX2935*#*My daughter Clara is a nurse. She was in Europe on a business trip. It’s quite hard to get by without her. I spent the whole pension already. I will have to do with what I have until she returns.
SPCX2936*#*Maybe you will meet Clara if you stay awhile. I could certainly use your help. Clara will be busy with her new project. She sent me a telegram saying that she will be working on a new charity organization.
SPCX2937*#*She is looking for people to help her with her project. Please share the word. I would love to tell her I have already recruited volunteers once she arrives.
SPCX2938*#*When you have some free time, come and visit me. I will have a hot tea and freshly baked cake ready for you. And if you bring me more of those tasty fish, I can prepare them in any way you like.
SPCX2939*#*I am sure Clara could use your help too. She will have to set up an office for the organization. It’s called Red Cross, maybe you have heard of it, yes? Anyway, she will need some furniture and other things.
SPCX294*#*There’s been a small hold up in the trade. If we show our new weapons to the good merchant we should have the gold ready in no time.
SPCX2940*#*I am so glad I met you. Clara is a strong woman but she has a lot to do with taking care of the house and her work in the hospital. And now there is the new project too.
SPCX2941*#*Please, sit down for a while. You are running around or sailing all the time. Christmas is a time of rest. I am sure you can take some time off. Well, there is this orphanage that could use your help but…
SPCX2942*#*You never fail to impress me with your generosity. But you can be sure I won’t let you leave with empty hands either. Now if you can, have a look at that roof of mine once again.
SPCX2943*#*I am no expert but I don’t think you can make the repairs alone? Don’t you have some friends to help you with that?
SPCX2944*#*You might need some bricks too to fill up that hole in the chimney. I guess that is the source of the leak.
SPCX2945*#*You are a dear. The roof looks as good as new. Now we will stay warm and dry inside even during a snowstorm. You must be starving after all that work, let me make you some dinner.
SPCX2946*#*Let’s go for a walk, captain. I must keep moving or these old bones will stay stiff like twigs. Come, help me put on my coat. And where did I put that scarf?
SPCX2947*#*No, no, I don’t need so many scarves. You know what? We can donate them to the local orphanage. I am sure the kids can use them. Let’s just pack them up in some crates so they don’t get wet in the snow.
SPCX2948*#*Look at that beautiful coat in the shop window! Clara would love it. And it looks like we will have a cold winter. She could definitely use a warm coat like that. It’s a pity I don’t have so much money.
SPCX2949*#*Clara will be pleased when she finds the coat under the Christmas tree. She likes practical presents. Hmm, there is a commotion at the port. Why don’t we go there and see what is going on?
SPCX295*#*Now that we have enough gold let’s upgrade our wardrobe. Some new hats and coats to show we ain’t poor.
SPCX2950*#*Oh my! Two ships have collided. I hope it is none of yours. The owners will need to make some serious repairs before those vessels can get afloat again.
SPCX2951*#*That is really unfortunate that it happened to be your ship there too. Is there any way I can help? I don’t know much about ships but I could cook some food for the workers repairing the damage.
SPCX2952*#*So how are the repairs going, captain? I hope you did not suffer a large financial loss. If you need some more materials for the repairs, there is a fine mine outside the city.
SPCX2953*#*Do you like to go to the Christmas Market? I used to have my own stand there and sell homemade cookies and jam. But I have not made enough this year. Do you have something we could sell there?
SPCX2954*#*These scarves are perfect, I am sure they will sell well. I just love the atmosphere of the Christmas Market. I have already rented a place on the square, we just need to get the stall now.
SPCX2955*#*Have you tasted the gingerbread cookies from the stall across ours? They are so good! Almost like mine. I might not have enough time to bake them before Christmas. How about we buy some instead?
SPCX2956*#*And where are your hard-working sailors? Call them to the Christmas Market. They should take their families too. The market is a great place for young and old too.
SPCX2957*#*Maybe we could try making some food too. You have access to wonderful fresh fish. How about we get a grill and cook them on fire? I am sure a lot of people would like a tasty grilled fish.
SPCX2958*#*You forgot about the grill. The fish will stay fresh in this cold, but please be quick about it. I kind of hope to get some warmth from the fire too. This cold seeps right into your bones.
SPCX2959*#*Perfect! Just get some wood or coal, dear. In the meantime, I will prepare the fish for cooking.
SPCX296*#*There is a new ship carrying something good not far. We shall take a closer look at it. I will leave some of me men looking after our precious treasure.
SPCX2960*#*Both our fish and scarves were really popular even though it was an unusual combination. Actually, I would love to have a stone grill at home on the terrace to grill the fish anytime I feel like.
SPCX2961*#*The Christmas Eve is almost here. How about we make some nice donation to the orphanage. I know you have already given the kids scarves but they would probably be more happy about some toys.
SPCX2962*#*Let’s decorate the Christmas tree. Let me just get the decorations... Oh no! They are all broken. We must buy new ornaments. But will there be any left in the shops this close to the Christmas day?
SPCX2963*#*You are a true savior, dear. I will decorate the tree and give you some time off. You should not spend the whole holidays helping an old woman. I am sure you have your own business to attend to as well.
SPCX2964*#*I got another telegram from Clara. She met an orphan girl on the ship. I’d love to meet her. I'm sad Clara never married and had her own kids. Let me check the pantry if we have enough food for another visitor.
SPCX2965*#*You are a sweetheart. You help me with everything I could possibly need. I would love to have you here for Christmas dinner. But you probably want to spend it with your own family, right?
SPCX2966*#*I won’t be alone. Clara’s ship should arrive shortly. And I hope she will bring little Eva too. Let’s prepare a nice surprise for the girl. I am sure she would like a teddy or two.
SPCX2967*#*I will let you go back to your business. But don’t work so much you forget to spend time with your family. Christmas is all about some quality family time.
SPCX2968*#*I have prepared a present for you, dear. You will receive it in a moment. Just help this old woman to gather some wood for the fireplace.
SPCX2969*#*Yes, yes, I know you want the presents already. Just give me a hug and it will be yours. But please don’t forget to stop by sometime and help Clara with her charity project. She would appreciate it.
SPCX297*#*The wretched bilge rats! They took of with me gold. Ye can’t trust no one in this trade. Let this be a lesson to ye. Now get me that gold back. I don’t care how.
SPCX2970*#*This was a great Christmas. I received so many toys I have nowhere to put them. Maybe a big crate will do, or a large shelf.
SPCX2971*#*We still did not find my parents but Clara promised to keep looking with me. We will have to travel a lot. That won’t be cheap. But you can always take us on your boats, right?
SPCX2972*#*Clara wants to talk to you. It’s probably about her project. Something about that building in the city. She probably needs your help. But promise to come with me to look for my parents later.
SPCX2973*#*Clara said that mum and dad might have gone to the shelter for poor people. She also wanted to bring some food when we go there. That they always need more especially in winter.
SPCX2974*#*There are kids like me in here. They look very sad. Can we help them somehow? You know what made me really happy? When I tasted my first candy cane!
SPCX2975*#*It’s not much but at least they have something tasty to eat. What now? We should ask someone about my parents.
SPCX2976*#*They were really here! Do you have the address that lady gave you? Let’s go there right now! Why did you promise to help in the shelter? You can do that later.
SPCX2977*#*Can we go now? Please? Will we take one of your ships or do we go by train? I saw the train station when we went to the shelter. I never traveled by train before.
SPCX2978*#*That train ride was fun. Is that the house? But it’s on the other side of the river. How will we get across? I see no bridge nearby.
SPCX2979*#*I see an old man through the window. That can’t be my dad. He is not so old. But where are they then? Knock on the door, captain!
SPCX298*#*And they took one of me ships too. I know about one we could use instead, Fortune is her name. We need only to free her from her current owners and she will be ours.
SPCX2980*#*So they moved away. But how will we find them now? The old man did not know where they went. Maybe we can ask some fishermen here, maybe they know my dad.
SPCX2981*#*We can make a stop at the shelter and leave them some clothes for the poor people. They will need warm things in the winter.
SPCX2982*#*Let’s go to the port now! The fishermen will help us for sure if we get them some new harpoons. If my parents lived here, dad must have gone there to look for work.
SPCX2983*#*The port is so big! It’s nothing like the small port at home. It will take us days to ask all the people here. If we only had someone to help us.
SPCX2984*#*There is a man and he met my dad! But he does not want to say what he knows unless we give him some money. But it’s too much. Why won’t he just tell us?
SPCX2985*#*So he took them to another city on his boat. He will take us there if we help him deliver some marble to the factory across the river.
SPCX2986*#*Do you see that poor man on the street? Let’s give him some food and ask him about my parents. Maybe he saw them.
SPCX2987*#*Dad? Is that you? I can’t believe it! Is mum here too? Captain, captain! Come, here! I found dad!
SPCX2988*#*This is great. Dad says mum is working as a waitress in the tavern and they live in a room upstairs. They were too poor to come back for me. But they were saving up money.
SPCX2989*#*Now I just need to get Mr. Snowflake and his siblings and we can be a happy family again. Will you help me get them, captain? And I must say goodbye to Clara too.
SPCX299*#*We may be pirates but we need some rules to follow. No stealing from yer mates will be tolerated anymore. I better set them in stone to make it clear.
SPCX2990*#*Captain! So good of you to accept my invitation. Please, sit and put your things down. We have a business to talk about.
SPCX2991*#*I have been given a mission by the Russian Emperor to explore the Southern Sea. Unfortunately my second in command, Mr. Lazarev, has fallen sick. And we are to sail off tomorrow.
SPCX2992*#*I am so glad that you accept. There is a ship prepared for you. The sturdy Mirny will be yours to command. Please, have a look at her, there is still some time for some last moment's adjustments.
SPCX2993*#*Mirny is not large but sturdy and agile, perfect for the ice-covered seas around the South Pole. You should be able to fill her up with enough supplies for the whole voyage.
SPCX2994*#*Talk to your sailors and make sure they take enough warm clothing. Most of the time we will be sailing in ice-cold waters.
SPCX2995*#*I don’t plan on going on land but we should be ready for everything. So take some ice picks and snowshoes.
SPCX2996*#*I see you have taken salted fish. But in the cold and harsh conditions, we will need something more filling. There is special food made by the people living up north. It’s called pemmican.
SPCX2997*#*Good, we have enough pemmican now. Just don’t ask me what is it made of. And try not to taste it too much when you eat it. We should be ready to go. Just take some spare wood for fire.
SPCX2998*#*It will be a long voyage to get to the south. We will have to cross the equator and pass through some hot areas. We can buy some fresh produce in those lands and enjoy the warmth while we can.
SPCX2999*#*We should have build more stoves on the ships. I was wary of having too much fire on the wooden ships, but if we don’t want to suffer from the cold we will need them. Just make sure they are fireproof.
SPCX300*#*Let's enjoy some leisure time. Ye need to let yer men rest and have fun for a while. Or they will all turn against ye sooner or later. Now get them something to eat.
SPCX3000*#*Now that the stoves are done we can use them to roast some fish. But not the salted fish we have in crates. Let’s catch some fresh ones.
SPCX3001*#*Now I am ready to brave the cold waters of the South Sea. Make sure everyone is ready too. Now is the last chance to get some supplies. I doubt we will find any more people ahead.
SPCX3002*#*Living in Russia, I am quite used to the cold but is your crew too? You should go check on them. The temperature is getting lower each hour.
SPCX3003*#*They are shivering, aren’t they? A few of them can get warmed up inside but we need most on deck. Give them at least some pemmican, that will refill their energy.
SPCX3004*#*Even if we find some land in the Southern Sea, don’t expect there to be any trees. In such cold only moss can grow. So let’s get some wood now.
SPCX3005*#*I believe there is land behind those icebergs. We should get closer and collect some samples. Then we will try to sail around it and map the coast of it.
SPCX3006*#*Remember to sail westward should we lose sight of each other. Have you forgotten your compass? I can sell you one of mine, but this is prime quality so expect a high price.
SPCX3007*#*How is it going? How are your sailors taking the cold? Make sure they are clothed properly, gloves and hats are a necessity in this weather.
SPCX3008*#*I can see land free of the ice fields further north. We can make a stop there, get some fresh water and food supplies.
SPCX3009*#*Before we continue with our voyage, let’s check the hull of the ships. The ice can make serious damage to wood. Maybe we should strengthen it with some metal.
SPCX301*#*A pirate never takes rest for long. So we will blockade a port. This cannot be done with only the men we have. Recruit some in the taverns from nearby towns.
SPCX3010*#*My ship is stuck in the ice. We need to get her out before the ice gets even thicker. Get all the men here. Let’s hope we can free her with some icepicks and ropes.
SPCX3011*#*Good! The ship is free. Let’s continue the voyage. If you spot any interesting points on the sea, mark them in your journal. I will include them in my map later.
SPCX3012*#*There are a few scattered islands before us. I don’t recommend stopping there, we could get stuck in the ice again. But if you want, you can collect some rock samples. Just be quick about it.
SPCX3013*#*There is a storm before us. We better prepare ourselves. In this cold, there won’t be rain but snow coming down on us. Still, the stormy sea will make us all wet. Have some dry clothing in reserve.
SPCX3014*#*The hats are fine, but you will also need cloak, socks and other garments. I can sell you some. I always pack more than needed.
SPCX3015*#*That island looks familiar. I think we already sailed this way. Let’s anchor here for a while and resupply.
SPCX3016*#*Yes, we were definitely here before. That means we have already circumnavigated the Southern Continent. I have still some blank places on my map. We have enough food, so let’s go round once more.
SPCX3017*#*This is an important discovery. Before us hardly anyone believed there is land around the South Pole. We should bring more earth samples to prove our discovery.
SPCX3018*#*I would love to explore the continent myself. But this was not our mission. Maybe we could make just a short stop. But on foot, we won’t go far in this deep snow.
SPCX3019*#*The emperor will be pleased with our discoveries. I will make sure your name is mentioned too.
SPCX302*#*Not many ships are in the port, this should be easy. Let’s send them a kind greeting from our cannons and they will surrender in no time.
SPCX3020*#*Hello, captain. So you are to join my next expedition? It’s a pleasure to meet you. Just a moment, I will give you a list of the equipment you will need. It won’t be cheap but necessary.
SPCX3021*#*I was just overseeing the reinforcing of my ship Fram when I learned Mr. Scott from England is going for the South Pole. I was planning to go to the Arctic but should we leave the South to the British?
SPCX3022*#*So do you have any experience sailing the ice-filled waters? You may be a good captain, but the cold can get even the best explorers. How did you prepare for the frozen polar regions?
SPCX3023*#*Firewood will be useful but a nourishing food is essential too. Pemmican is an energy packed mix of fat and protein, I learned about it from the Inuits. It’s not so bad once you get used to it.
SPCX3024*#*Do you know some cold-resistant men available to join our expedition? If they are experienced sailors and explorers, they will be welcome on our journey.
SPCX3025*#*The travel on land will be covered by sleds pulled by dogs. I have brought sled dogs from Greenland. This one is Obersten, isn’t he just cute? Sit! Who is a good boy?
SPCX3026*#*I don’t think fish are his favorite. But if you have sausage, the dogs will fall in love with you instantly. Let’s go inspect the sleds now. We will have to pile all our supplies on them.
SPCX3027*#*I had made special clothes inspired by the furs worn by the North American Inuits. I will show them to you. You just need to get some hats. I kind of forgot about them.
SPCX3028*#*I am going to get some books and musical instruments. This will help the mood in such unpleasant conditions. You can check if our quartermaster needs anything.
SPCX3029*#*There, all packed! I just need you to go to the pet shop and get some dog food. We can’t let our furry companions get hungry. If you give the shop owner some cages, he will give you the food for free.
SPCX303*#*One ship was carrying big chunks of stone. It may seem ordinary but I can see something green glittering in the cracks. Bring it to me so I can have a closer look at it.
SPCX3030*#*We have some serious financial issues. The government refused me another donation so I had to mortgage my house. Let’s hope this mission will be a success or I will go bankrupt.
SPCX3031*#*Good, now we are ready to set sail. Our next stop will be at the island, Madeira. There we will decide what will be our final destination. And we can also get some more food.
SPCX3032*#*We are going south. We will be the first people to conquer the South Pole. Maybe we should warn Mr. Scott he has competition. Let’s send him a message by our sailors.
SPCX3033*#*We still have access to some fresh food, but you should start getting used to the pemmican. It will be easier to keep it in if you start slowly. So let’s make it our lunch today.
SPCX3034*#*A message came from Norway. It seems we have little support at home. Nobody likes this sudden change of plans. You see, I told everyone we are going to the North Pole. I am sure we can make it anyway.
SPCX3035*#*We should arrive at the Bay of Whales soon. It’s the perfect starting point for the trek to the pole. It’s a rocky bay where we can anchor safely. And our geologist can do his job too.
SPCX3036*#*We will make our main camp here. We need to build a sturdy hut that will withstand the strong eastern wind. Can you get the materials with ships? Then we will transfer them across the land with dog sleds.
SPCX3037*#*The hut looks good. It should keep us all safe from the cold. Let’s go inside to get warmed up. We can eat something and go over the plan.
SPCX3038*#*It’s getting dark outside. Someone should check on the dogs and give them some food. Wait! Don’t go out there without a hat! Do you want your ears to freeze off?
SPCX3039*#*How are Obersten and the other dogs? They are taking the cold well, that’s good. I selected the Greenland breed as they are the sturdiest animals. But they weren’t cheap. I am still in debt because of them.
SPCX304*#*We were lucky and almost no fighting was needed in our last few raids. But ye must be prepared for action any time. Let’s add some more cannons to my flagship.
SPCX3040*#*There is still a lot to do before we go for the pole. We are going to set up supply depots on the planned route. The depots must be secure so that no animal fills its belly with our food.
SPCX3041*#*Now, that we have set up the depots we can prepare the supplies and bring them there on the sleds. This way we won’t have to carry so much stuff once we go to the pole.
SPCX3042*#*I and two of my men are going to bring the supplies to the depots. In the meantime, I need you to take the ship and go buy more supplies in Buenos Aires. We will need them to wait out the polar night.
SPCX3043*#*We will have to wait out the polar night at our camp, Framheim. There will be no sunlight for four months and we couldn’t survive the cold. Let’s collect more food before the night sets in.
SPCX3044*#*The dark and cold is very bad for the morale of the men. Let’s stay all together to keep warm. We can read the books I brought and play some music on the gramophone.
SPCX3045*#*It’s still pretty cold out there, but I am not waiting any longer. I won’t let that Englishman beat us to the Pole. So put on your coat and hat and let’s go!
SPCX3046*#*This was a mistake. The cold is unbearable. Some dogs have frostbitten paws and the men are not feeling much better. We have to turn back. But let’s keep most of the supplies at the nearest depot.
SPCX3047*#*We need to wait until spring before we set off again. Meanwhile, we can send a ship for supplies to Buenos Aires. I hate this waiting, but there is no point going out there only to freeze to death.
SPCX3048*#*It’s October and the spring has arrived at the Southern Hemisphere. It’s still hellishly cold, but we should be able to survive it. Get those skis and let’s get going.
SPCX3049*#*Let’s make a camp here. We can build an igloo out of ice, but find a place with solid rocks to build it on. I don’t fancy waking up in freezing water.
SPCX305*#*Now that we can deal damage we should be also able to take some damage. Let’s strengthen the ship's hull to make it more sturdy. Sea battles can become violent.
SPCX3050*#*There is a mountain range before us. Those will be the Transantarctic Mountains. We will have to find a way to cross them. Send out some men to scout the terrain ahead of us.
SPCX3051*#*We are near the third supply depot. Let’s go for the food we stored there. I am so hungry I will enjoy even some pemmican. The dogs must be starving too.
SPCX3052*#*We will need to build a contraption to carry the sleds across the mountains. There won’t be a clear path all the way across. But the dogs should be able to get through on their own.
SPCX3053*#*I am so glad we chose to take the dogs instead of motorized sleds. I wonder how Scott is doing. He won't have it easy if he runs out of fuel.
SPCX3054*#*I just realized I forgot the skis under the reef. We must go back for them. It should not take long now that everything else is up here.
SPCX3055*#*Let me just check my compass. We should be nearing the pole. We can make a camp over there by the rocks. We can make a wall from them so they will shield us from the wind.
SPCX3056*#*What is that? Is that Scott and his crew? Hmm, it does not move. It might be a mirage. Ah! Those will be droppings from our dogs. That reminds me, we should feed them.
SPCX3057*#*According to my compass, the South Pole is somewhere here. Let’s plant here the Norwegian flag and leave a letter for Scott. We are the first!
SPCX3058*#*We have already won this race and I am not cold-hearted even though it’s freezing here. Let’s leave some supplies for Scott here. We have enough for the return journey.
SPCX3059*#*Let’s hurry back. I can’t wait to get on the ship and sail home with the news of our achievement. So put those skis on your feet and let get going!
SPCX306*#*Being a successful pirate presents a few problems. People try to catch you or are afraid and avoid you. So let’s take our men and find a new place for our trade.
SPCX3060*#*Captain! Are you here to join my expedition? I am still looking for experienced explorers to come with me to the Antarctic. However, I will need proof of your skills first.
SPCX3061*#*We will surely have a use for a good supplier. We also need to recruit some seasoned sailors too. The first part of the voyage will be on our ship Terra Nova.
SPCX3062*#*I have already been to the Antarctic and know the local conditions. You have nothing to worry about if you join me. We are just starting to collect the food supplies. How about you help us with that?
SPCX3063*#*We will have the most modern equipment including some motor sleds. We are also taking sturdy Manchurian ponies and a few sled dogs. Of course, we need a lot of funding for this.
SPCX3064*#*There are still supplies we need. Can you take care of it? I need to talk to the investors. We are still short on money. Such an expedition requires a lot of finances.
SPCX3065*#*We are not going only for the pole-hunt. There will be scientists with us who will be conducting important research. And they will need their equipment, which we can’t forget.
SPCX3066*#*I have ordered some skis made especially for the expedition. But it seems the woodworker can’t find the wood I requested. Do you have any idea where we can find it?
SPCX3067*#*The whole crew will have clothing made of wool. There is a pair of breeches and a jacket for you too. But we could still use a few fur hats. I have not bought any yet.
SPCX3068*#*The time to set sail is here. I must ask you for a favor. Please take care of Terra Nova for now. I need to stay here and finish some business. I will join you in South Africa.
SPCX3069*#*I was not as successful as I hoped. I will have to leave you for a bit in Melbourne again. There is a potential investor I need to meet. You just sail on and maybe collect some supplies.
SPCX307*#*I like this place. I may even make a temporary home here. Build it on the beach near the sea. The local merchant will sell us the material for some ammunition.
SPCX3070*#*The investor will help us but I have some concerning news. We will be racing to the Pole against Roald Amundsen. Tell the men to hurry up, we can’t let him get there first.
SPCX3071*#*He is a Norwegian explorer and should be going to the Arctic right now. I wonder what made him change his plans. I still believe we can make it to the pole first. But let's check our equipment.
SPCX3072*#*The pemmican tastes really awful. But it will give us the energy we will need. Although, if we have some stale bread, I would enjoy it much more. We don’t? Ah, just give me the pemmican.
SPCX3073*#*We are taking on water! And the pumps have failed. We need to grab buckets and get that water out of the ship. Now!
SPCX3074*#*At last, the storm is over. We can continue to the Cape Evans, as I named it. I have selected it as a place for our base camp, Hut Point. There we will build a large hut.
SPCX3075*#*Once the hut is finished, we can move the supplies inside. The shore here should remain ice-free during the summer so a small party with the ship can get us more supplies.
SPCX3076*#*Let’s put on those woolen clothes and fur hats. It may be summer yet, but the temperature here is never too high.
SPCX3077*#*The hut looks good. I will start the depot lying to supply us on the journey to the pole. You should take Terra Nova and our scientists to do their work and maybe buy more supplies in New Zealand.
SPCX3078*#*You have found Amundsen’s base camp? Oh, that man...! I am calm, don’t worry. We must proceed with our plan without stress. Panicking now would just endanger the mission.
SPCX3079*#*Sitting out through the winter is just unbearable! But Amundsen can’t get out in these temperatures either. We must be patient. Let’s play a game of football outside. It will keep the men fit and occupied.
SPCX308*#*Exotic furniture, beautiful rugs and paintings must be everywhere. As my apprentice I expect you to pay for it. Surely you have enough money after our exploits.
SPCX3080*#*I hoped the ponies would be more of a help here, but they are not faring well in this cold. We will have to rely on the sleds and skis to get to the pole.
SPCX3081*#*We are ready to set out. Will you join the party on the sleds and deliver more supplies to the depots ahead? Don’t forget the wood for the fire. We will need it.
SPCX3082*#*Both sleds broke down? It seems we can’t shake off this bad luck. Join us for the journey to the pole. We need more men since we have no sleds or ponies left. Yes, we had to butcher the ponies for food.
SPCX3083*#*We can’t go on in this blizzard. Let’s break camp and wait it out. Those rocks over there can shelter us from the wind. Let’s build the tents next to them.
SPCX3084*#*We ate a lot of our food rations while waiting for the blizzard to pass over. I am not sure if we can manage the way back with what is left. But let’s not worry about that now.
SPCX3085*#*Let’s hope the weather will be calm now so we can make up for the lost time. Still, the temperature is far below freezing point. Make sure to bundle up and keep moving.
SPCX3086*#*We are at the bottom of the Beardmore Glacier. I hope you have some experience with climbing. Now get out that gear and let’s start the ascent.
SPCX3087*#*The rocks are covered with ice and snow and are slippery. Make sure to hold on to something. Then help the men below you once you are on safe ground.
SPCX3088*#*At last, we are on the polar plateau. That was quite a dangerous climb. Let’s make a short stop and check the supplies before we brave the snowy wasteland again.
SPCX3089*#*The weather has calmed down a bit. Maybe the lady luck is back on our side. Put on the skis and let’s hurry south. I hope we can still make it to the pole before Amundsen.
SPCX309*#*We will need to build from the start again. A storm has easily destroyed the few walls we have built. A rich pirate like me deserves a proper castle anyway.
SPCX3090*#*We should be nearing the pole. But I can’t shake off this bad feeling. Maybe I am just hungry and cold. Let’s make a short stop and eat something.
SPCX3091*#*I have decided on the final party which will go the rest of the way to the pole. You are among them, captain. Three guys are going to turn back to the main camp. Give them everything you don’t need.
SPCX3092*#*I had to send them back, even as it is we have hardly enough supplies for all five of us. I know you can acquire fish almost anywhere but we could still suffer from the cold.
SPCX3093*#*I see something in the distance. Is that a flag? This does not mean anything good. Someone was here before us.
SPCX3094*#*Amundsen was here almost a month ago. We failed, my friend. Let’s get out of this terrible place as fast as we can. Maybe we can still bring the news home first. Even though we lost this race.
SPCX3095*#*Oates, one of our teammates has serious frostbite on his toes. It does not look good. He is slowing us down, but we can’t just leave him here. Let’s stop for a while and make a fire, maybe it will help.
SPCX3096*#*The temperature is getting really low. We should all put furs around our feet and hands before we get frostbitten too.
SPCX3097*#*We should reach the first supply depot soon. That should help us with the rest of the trek. Some food and oil for fire will refill our energy.
SPCX3098*#*There is not enough oil for fire. It must be because the sleds broke down earlier, they did not manage to bring in all the supplies. Let’s just keep moving that will keep us warm.
SPCX3099*#*We should have met the dog teams a long time ago. Something must have gone wrong. Captain, please take the best skis and go ahead. I have frostbite on my feet now too and can’t move properly.
SPCX310*#*Now I can live like a pirate lord and enjoy all my riches! I think a feast for the lord is called for. And also let’s celebrate your graduation to a full-fledged pirate!
SPCX3100*#*You almost stepped on a precious vase from the 9th century. It’s already cracked, but you could have destroyed it completely. Help me get it out of the ground.
SPCX3101*#*That was a bit rude of me. I am Charlotte, an archeologist working on this site. This used to be the old harbor. Have you paid the entrance fee already? If so, I can show you around.
SPCX3102*#*It’s not a large site but there are still many things to be uncovered. Like that old anchor over there. It’s stuck among the roots of a tree. It will take some work to get it free.
SPCX3103*#*Ah! I broke my trowel trying to free that thing. I will have to check my bag if I have a spare one. But that one was my favorite. Good equipment is hard to come by.
SPCX3104*#*I suspect the anchor belonged to the royal barge of the first king of Norway, Harald Fairhair. I am writing a book about his life. I can tell you a lot more about him when we go to lunch.
SPCX3105*#*I may have some work for you, captain. I need to transport the artifacts I found to the museum in Oslo. But if you take them, make sure they are packaged properly. They are really fragile.
SPCX3106*#*The artifacts should be safe in these crates but tell your crew to handle them with care. There is a lot of fragile pottery that could break apart easily.
SPCX3107*#*Ah, you are back? There is this large stone and I can’t get it to move. I suspect there is a crypt or an ancient cellar underneath it. Help me with it, please.
SPCX3108*#*It truly is a crypt. It’s awfully dark in there. Do you have a lamp on you? Me neither. You could go to the nearest shop, maybe they sell at least some candles there. I will wait for you here.
SPCX3109*#*We have the light but I still can’t see the bottom of the crypt. So now we need a rope or a ladder to get down there. I think we had a ladder in the shed somewhere. Go look for it.
SPCX311*#*I am Isabella of Castile. I have heard about you from my dear friend Columbus. He said that you are a competent sailor and captain. I could use your help in some matters.
SPCX3110*#*Before we go down there, take my bag with archeological equipment. I am sure we will find something valuable but we might have to dig it out first.
SPCX3111*#*We might be down there for a while. Maybe we should take some food with us. And in the worst case, that we get stuck in the tomb, at least we can survive until someone finds us.
SPCX3112*#*The tomb is dated to the tenth century A.D. and belongs to someone important. Do you see all the golden items placed around the walls? We will need some wooden supports to keep the ceiling from collapsing here.
SPCX3113*#*We should get some guys to install the supports for the ceiling. Meanwhile, we can continue deeper into the crypt. It’s not a difficult task, your sailors could do it too.
SPCX3114*#*The writing on these tombstones indicates that these are the servants of a great king. We must have stumbled upon a real treasure here. Let’s get the tombstones to the surface and then to the museum.
SPCX3115*#*The ceiling has collapsed here. We will need some dynamite to remove the rubble. Don’t worry I know just how to work with it to not destroy the whole crypt. You just go and buy the explosives.
SPCX3116*#*Now we need to get as far as possible. Actually, you might as well go and bring some more equipment. I guess we will need a pickaxe, a shovel, and some other things.
SPCX3117*#*Now we are getting somewhere! Get me a more subtle tool so I can dig out this artifact here. It looks like some sort of a book but instead of paper, leather was used.
SPCX3118*#*I will take the book and we can look at it later. Over there is the main sarcophagus. Let’s have closer look at it. I think we stumbled upon the tomb of Harald Fairhair, the first king of Norway.
SPCX3119*#*This is a big discovery. Since you have helped me so much already, how about we read the book together? Let’s get something to eat and dive into the life story of Harald.
SPCX312*#*The reign of my incompetent brother Henry has left the kingdom in poor shape. We have a lot of work to do. Let’s start with getting some coins to fill the empty treasury.
SPCX3120*#*Sailor! You, yes you! I need you on my crew. I have a lot of bloodthirsty warriors but a proper sailor who can sail the sea is still needed. Take an oar and show me what you can do.
SPCX3121*#*Yes, I was looking for someone like you. We are going to conquer these lands together. You will take care of the sailing and I will cover the fighting. But you better have some steel on hand too.
SPCX3122*#*Let’s go grab a tankard of mead and get to know each other before we begin our quest. I could use something to eat too.
SPCX3123*#*I am not a power-hungry man as you might have thought. It’s all for love. There is a beautiful girl who I asked to marry me. But she said I have to conquer all of Norway first. Women.
SPCX3124*#*A strange request maybe. But she is not just any fisherman's daughter. She is a princess. Gyda is her name. She could be a statue made by a master mason, such is her beauty.
SPCX3125*#*If you are going with me, you will need to to know how to handle an axe. I can’t protect you at all times, so you need to take care of yourself. Let me show you a few tricks.
SPCX3126*#*The plan is to approach the villages from the sea. We will fly the flag of an ally and surprise them. But we will need more sailors to handle the ships.
SPCX3127*#*Come, and have a look at the drakkars I bought. You are a sailor, so you should know a good ship from a bad one, right? Tell me, are these any good?
SPCX3128*#*The first village we are going to conquer is Värmland. I have some trustworthy information about their defenses and warriors. So get yourself a helmet or something because we are taking off soon.
SPCX3129*#*We are going to the village, you wait here on the ship. You can catch fish or something but be ready to sail away fast should we have to retreat all of a sudden.
SPCX313*#*What we need to do is bring order to this country. Criminals are unpunished and free robbing and hurting my people. This has to stop! So we are going to build a prison.
SPCX3130*#*Come, it’s safe to go to the village now. The conquest was successful. But have your axe on you. We need to install fear in the villagers lest they try something stupid.
SPCX3131*#*We will need gold to get better weapons and armor for the next fight. Let’s look if the villagers have something to donate us. Let’s call it taxes for the new king.
SPCX3132*#*Some fools have barricaded themselves in the town hall. Let’s get the mice out of that hole. I bet they have all the gold right there.
SPCX3133*#*Ah, just women and children. I shall be merciful today, let them be. But first, they must accept me as their new king. Let’s make it official and call all our men too.
SPCX3134*#*Let’s make this a temporary seat of the new king of Norway. I will need a throne first and then we can plan the next steps of my conquest. A large chair as the throne will do.
SPCX3135*#*I promised Gyda I would not cut my hair before I become the king of all Norway. But it gets all tangled up in my armor. I have already broken two wooden combs on it. It’s really a nuisance.
SPCX3136*#*Oh, good. With combed hair, I look much more presentable. Now we can have a feast to celebrate our victory. Did you manage to catch any fish during the battle?
SPCX3137*#*We are ready to go and conquer the next village but I have a special task for you, sailor. The next few villages can be reached on foot so I don’t need your expertise. But first, we need more weapons.
SPCX3138*#*So that special task I mentioned… I need you to go to Gyda and make sure she is waiting for me. Bring her a nice gift from me and tell her I am thinking of her.
SPCX3139*#*Should you spot any other men around her, make sure they know she is taken. And if they won’t listen, I will come and slice them to pieces. Make sure they know that too.
SPCX314*#*The main building is done. It looks secure enough. Now we only need to finish the details like bars and doors for the cells. Make sure the iron is of good quality.
SPCX3140*#*And who might you be? Some kind of messenger?
SPCX3141*#*So you are a sailor. Your ship is really impressive. But I hope Harald sent something more than just a fish smelling sailor and his ship.
SPCX3142*#*Ah, well. The gold will do. But I am bored here. I asked Harald to become the king just so that he can tell me all about his battles. I wish I could fight too. But my father would never allow that.
SPCX3143*#*Holding a sword is already exciting! So do you know how to fight? Can you show me some moves? But let’s sail somewhere where no one will see us.
SPCX3144*#*Ha! That was fun. Stay here with me for a while. I have not had so much fun in a long time. Can I try sailing on your ship too? Just in the bay for a little bit.
SPCX3145*#*Father must not find out you teach me fighting and sailing. You know what? You can just pretend to help me prepare the feast for my father’s birthday. It’s in a few weeks.
SPCX3146*#*There is a small cottage on the hill above our house. It is a bit run down, but if you repair it, we could use it to practice sword fighting.
SPCX3147*#*Perfect! Just repair the roof now. Rain and snow is nothing unusual here.
SPCX3148*#*I mentioned you are helping me prepare the feast. You remember that, right? Now we really must prepare it because my parents took my word for it. I don’t feel like it but what can we do? Let’s go shopping.
SPCX3149*#*My father is just a small king in his village but he likes his feasts large. He will surely invite all the neighboring villages. They might be our temporary allies but we will need to double the security.
SPCX315*#*Now that we have the jail constructed we can organize a police that will keep order. Try to recruit some sailors from the port. I think some might be interested in joining.
SPCX3150*#*All the important warriors need a special drinking horn for their mead. It’s just some silly tradition if you ask me. A simple cup should be good for everyone.
SPCX3151*#*We will need a lot of food. Meat, fruit, bread… I know people who can get us all of that. You just take care of the fish.
SPCX3152*#*Since you are a sailor you can take care of the transportation of the guests. Father thinks he will look like a rich man if he sends a ship for every guest. Let’s just make him happy.
SPCX3153*#*Ah, I am so bored of these preparations. Do you know how many feasts I had to attend already? Too many. As a princess, I must sit there silently and drink only water. So boring! Let’s go sailing instead!
SPCX3154*#*I know why you became a sailor. Everything is so much better at sea. Let’s have a quick fencing session before we need to get back. Doing it on deck will improve my balance too.
SPCX3155*#*Before we get back home, let’s stop at the pelts merchant. I want to make a new cloak for father. It will be his birthday gift. And maybe I could purchase some leather for a light armor for me.
SPCX3156*#*Father promised to the village people to build a new altar to Odin. He wants to reveal the altar during the feast. But the work has barely started. Maybe you could help him with it.
SPCX3157*#*The preparations for the feast are done. Maybe we should get more drinking horns. When the men get drunk they break them as a show of their strength.
SPCX3158*#*You must probably get back to Harald soon. But take me once more on your ship. Let’s sail along the coast and maybe catch some fish or something. It was really nice sailing with you.
SPCX3159*#*Thank you, sailor, for your company. I really enjoyed our time together. And tell Harald I am waiting for him. I believe he can do it, he can become the king of all Norway.
SPCX316*#*We have already our first prisoners. They are criminals but we don’t want them to starve while serving their sentence. Some basic food like fish will suffice.
SPCX3160*#*How is Gyda? What did she say? Did she like the gold I sent her?
SPCX3161*#*Everything is going to plan. We managed to conquer three more villages while you were gone. We need more men for the next village. They have quite a few warriors defending it.
SPCX3162*#*Your sailors will do. Just get them some weapons. My warriors will show them a few moves and they should be ready.
SPCX3163*#*Swords are fine but don’t forget the famous and deadly Viking axes. No one can stand up to a Norseman if he has an axe and a shield in hand.
SPCX3164*#*We are ready for the next battle. You can stay on the ship, captain. No need to endanger yourself. We will win this fight and meet on the beach. Just make sure the ships are safe.
SPCX3165*#*You can greet the new king of Norway, captain. I am ready to cut this annoying hair to a reasonable length. And a new crown would be the perfect thing to accentuate my new haircut.
SPCX3166*#*Before I go to see Gyda we should start building a house for us. The king and queen of all Norway should have a proper house of stone. Not just a wooden hut like most people.
SPCX3167*#*I am ready. I will go ask Gyda to be my wife. This time she won’t refuse. I hope. You can start preparing things for the wedding.
SPCX3168*#*I admit I was a bit nervous but she kept her word, just like I kept mine.
SPCX3169*#*I have been talking with our historian. He is writing the accounts of my life into a series of poems. I will mention you too. Now come, let’s get a horn-full of mead and celebrate my wedding!
SPCX317*#*I have sponsored Columbus’s voyage to the New World. There is still so much to discover. I am sure that financing more journeys to the New World will pay its worth.
SPCX3170*#*A new challenge is here! Prove your skills as a capable captain by delivering Diamonds. Buy the Diamonds from the Merchant. If you can make it, great rewards will be yours.
SPCX3171*#*Please, allow me to introduce myself. I am Katsu Kaishu, the captain of the Kanrin Maru. Please join me for a plate of sushi.
SPCX3172*#*I heard you are an experienced captain and sailor. The Kanrin Maru is our first steamship and I am ashamed to admit, we Japanese don’t have much experience with such vessels.
SPCX3173*#*Very humbly I ask for your help. I am going on an important mission to the United States of America, a great country across the ocean. We need more experienced sailors such as yourself.
SPCX3174*#*Thank you very much, captain-san. Japan will be forever in your debt. Please advise me what do I need to obtain for such a long voyage. We can go and buy materials in Edo.
SPCX3175*#*We have many beautiful and precious things in Japan and we have already chosen some as gifts for the Americans. But maybe you know more about western culture. What would they like?
SPCX3176*#*We make our sake from rice. It tastes a bit different than this wine. Now we need to get the fuel for the voyage across the Pacific. We don’t have much deposits of coal in Japan so we will have to produce it.
SPCX3177*#*We will be taking the personnel of the Japanese Embassy with us. These are important people and they need comfort on the ship, a soft bed and a warm stove in each cabin.
SPCX3178*#*If you are interested, I can tell you a lot about Japan. Like our traditions, our ships, and our food. We can try catching a fugu fish. I know how to prepare it safely. You never tasted such a delicacy.
SPCX3179*#*And like a dessert, we can have mochi. It’s a pastry from rice flour. I like it most with cocoa filling, but it is very rare in Japan. If you don’t have any cocoa, we will fill them with red bean paste.
SPCX318*#*The beautiful country to the south - Granada has been taken over by invaders. I think it’s time to send them home again. But my men cannot do that without some weaponry.
SPCX3180*#*Now we can sail on, captain-san. Our destination is Los Angeles. Have you been there before? No? Then we should take a compass.
SPCX3181*#*I promised my wife to bring her some western clothing from America. Do you think I can buy it there for yen? I have no other money.
SPCX3182*#*An American ship will be joining us. The Powhatan will show us the way to Los Angeles. We just need to have enough coal to follow her.
SPCX3183*#*We are getting left behind by the Powhatan. There might be something wrong with Kanrin Maru. Can you inspect the engine room, captain-san? You surely know more about the steam machine than me.
SPCX3184*#*We had too much cargo and it was slowing us down. We have taken too many statues and marble. Kanrin Maru was not built for such a heavy cargo. We need to deliver it separately.
SPCX3185*#*Now we are sailing with good speed. We can invite the captain of the Powhatan to dine with us. We can ask him about his country and what we can expect once we get there.
SPCX3186*#*Captain-san, can we speak in private? I have a problem. My formal kimono does not fit. I must have gained weight. Please, help me make a new one. I can sew it myself, I just need some cloth.
SPCX3187*#*I am very much indebted to you. But let’s get back to sailor’s business. I am an experienced sailor in my country but I know little about the western shipbuilding. Tell me more about it.
SPCX3188*#*Yes, we still rely very much on wood in shipbuilding. But as you say, metal is the future. I will think about it. But it will make the ships much more expensive, won’t it?
SPCX3189*#*It’s good doing business with you. We also hope to improve our knowledge with the treaty we are going to sign with the United States. We were isolated for so long it froze our technological development.
SPCX319*#*Another voyage to the New World should start soon. We will need some new ships which can endure the wild waters of the ocean.
SPCX3190*#*For a long time, we have sailed only in the coastal waters. We did not wish to make contact with other nations so we stayed on our islands. Now we need to accept the help of other sailors like you.
SPCX3191*#*We are nearing our destination. We should prepare for the official welcome. I will need to join our ambassadors. Can you take care of the unloading of our cargo?
SPCX3192*#*While the official negotiations are running we could stroll around the city. We are just the sailors, they don’t need us there. Let’s go inspect their shipyard first!
SPCX3193*#*I see their ships are much more developed than most of ours. But Kainan Maru will be the first of many such ships in Japan. I will bring back materials which will help us build the new Japanese fleet.
SPCX3194*#*Now we have time to taste some local food. I am not so brave in food tasting as I am in sailing so let’s eat something familiar. Like fish. Maybe some local cook can prepare them for us.
SPCX3195*#*Our ambassadors have successfully signed the Treaty of Commerce. They are having a celebration and we are invited. We can bring some cakes for the party.
SPCX3196*#*That was a party! I am almost sorry to go home. But my job is sailing, so let’s sail home. Oh, I almost forgot. I need to get those clothes for my wife. Help me choose something nice.
SPCX3197*#*I am sure my wife will like this dress. Thank you for helping me choose it, captain-san. Now we check Kainan Maru if she is ready for the voyage home. And fill her up with coal.
SPCX3198*#*The delegation has purchased many items to send back to Japan. They will help us learn about western culture and follow their technological development. Will you help me transport the goods?
SPCX3199*#*Let’s not forget the steamship parts. We can’t produce them in Japan yet, but we will learn. Even Kainan Maru was built by the Dutch. But don’t tell that to the Americans.
SPCX320*#*My docks are not big enough to hold all these new ships now. With the new lands in the West we will need large fleet and bigger docks. So let’s start the renovation.
SPCX3200*#*We are ready to sail home. The shogun will be most pleased with what we will bring with us. We can build a mighty fleet for Japan with these materials and information.
SPCX3201*#*We are missing a few sailors. They must be still wandering around the city. Let’s go look for them. We will find them faster if there is more of us.
SPCX3202*#*Shogun wants to hear what we learned in Los Angeles. Only the samurai are allowed in his presence, so you can’t come. But if you deliver food as a foreign merchant, you can enter the city.
SPCX3203*#*Shogun was pleased with the news I brought. But some unrest is brewing in Edo. It seems the Shogun has strong opposition. He plans to build a fleet which will help him suppress the rebels.
SPCX3204*#*I am forever loyal to the Shogun even though I can understand the arguments against him. I must work on that fleet he wants to build. Will you help me, captain-san?
SPCX3205*#*A few cities in Japan are open to foreign merchants like you. If you wish to stay here, you can trade with grapes. The Japanese have come to like the western wine. You can make good money with it.
SPCX3206*#*I have been appointed as the head of the Naval Academy in Kobe. Will you go visit one of my lectures? And I also need some materials to build a new hall. I know you can get them for me.
SPCX3207*#*I have some distressing news. We are close to a war. The Shogun’s rivals are making their move. It might not be safe for you here anymore, captain-san.
SPCX3208*#*Before you leave Japan, I have a last request. I am in charge of the shogun’s fleet and the next few steamships are shortly before their completion. We just need a few more parts.
SPCX3209*#*It’s time for the last bite of sushi and a cup of warm sake. Let’s say goodbyes properly, like friends. It was good knowing you, captain-san. Arigato.
SPCX321*#*The workers are doing a great job and the new docks will be ready soon. Let’s send them something tasty as a reward for their good work.
SPCX3210*#*You should collect your sailors and leave Japan. After the war ends, I will be waiting for your visit. I hope we will meet again.
SPCX322*#*I love this new delicacy Columbus has brought from the New World. I have already eaten all the chocolate he has given me before. Could you get me some more?
SPCX323*#*It seems the war in Granada will take some time. We are doing good for now but I will have to send more supplies to our troops and I will need coins for that.
SPCX324*#*The weapons and armor of our soldiers must be damaged already. I will send a blacksmith to the battlefield to repair their equipment. Can you bring some iron for him?
SPCX325*#*I want my people to know me as if I was their neighbor. I can’t be that for real of course, but if they saw my statue each day that might do the trick.
SPCX326*#*Columbus has brought some native people from the New World with him. But I can see they miss their country. Could you hire some sailors and send them back home?
SPCX327*#*My beloved husband Ferdinand will have birthday soon. I want to give him a gift that would make him happy. I know he would love a woodcarving of the two of us.
SPCX328*#*The war is won! It wasn’t easy but Granada is free again. Let’s make a feast for my loyal soldiers who have granted us this great victory.
SPCX329*#*The war is over but we cannot stay defenseless. To protect my people I need my armory full and soldiers properly equipped. Let’s refill what the war depleted.
SPCX330*#*I have decided to build a new school in town. Education is important and I want to make sure that my people have access to it. We shall build it near the town square.
SPCX331*#*The school is standing and looks good. The students will be able to study here everything from math to history. Let’s furnish it so that the lessons can start soon.
SPCX332*#*All we need now are some teachers. Unfortunately no one will teach for free so we will need to pay them. I hope there is enough gold for it in the royal treasury.
SPCX333*#*The Castilian wine is famous in all Europe. Our vineyards are extensive and fruitful. However the road to the vineyard is in bad shape. It needs to be paved anew.
SPCX334*#*My men have brought a plant from the new continent. It's called potato and they tell me it tastes amazing. I have to try it but first let’s get something to complement it.
SPCX335*#*We have built new ships and expanded the docks. However now we don’t have enough sailors to fill all these ships. Try to look for some in the nearby villages.
SPCX336*#*I have decided that chocolate should be available for all my people. They deserve to enjoy this delicacy too. So let’s supply a few shops in the town.
SPCX337*#*I have inspected the royal stables today. Everything looks fine but the horses could use new horseshoes. Could you ship me some of that quality iron you got me before?
SPCX338*#*Our new police is doing a great job. My people are much safer now. However, they cannot cover the northern part of my kingdom so we will need to hire more men.
SPCX339*#*Our royal palace is a magnificent building though a bit old now. Especially the northern wing is in bad shape and urgently needs some reconstruction.
SPCX340*#*We will also need some wood for the roof and pillars to complete the northern wing of the castle. After it is finished I will make a library of it.
SPCX341*#*The library is perfect. I will spend the whole evening reading. Can you tell the cook that I will eat my dinner here? He might need help with some ingredients.
SPCX342*#*The time to harvest grape vine from our vineyards has come. Get some men and harvest it before the birds eat it all. The grapes are delicious so they love to peck them.
SPCX343*#*Our guards fulfill their duties well. I was thinking that we could reward them with a new shining armor. The blacksmith just needs some materials so he can get to work.
SPCX344*#*The king of the neighboring country will come for a visit. We have some urgent matters to discuss. The feast must be remarkable as this is a most valued visitor.
SPCX345*#*The negotiations were successful. We have decided to wed our children and so seal an alliance. Let’s gather some finances for a magnificent wedding.
SPCX346*#*The wedding will take place in the palace gardens. After the ceremony a glorious feast will follow crowned by a delicious chocolate wedding cake.
SPCX347*#*My daughter will need an extraordinary dress for this special occasion. And a matching necklace of precious stones. You only get married once or a few times in life.
SPCX348*#*The cake is in the oven, the dress is ready. Now we need to prepare the venue. Get some workers who will set up the decorations and furniture in the garden.
SPCX349*#*Let’s not forget the wedding gift! I have already ordered a chariot made by a crafty carpenter. But any wood will not do here. It needs to be cherry wood.
SPCX350*#*The wedding was beautiful. I am sure my daughter will be happy even though her husband is a bit older than her. Let's buy her some food for the trip to her new home.
SPCX351*#*You thought Vikings are only fighters? Ha! Somebody needs to build the ships on which they sail. And that’s me, Floki. Let’s get to know each other over a lunch.
SPCX352*#*Shipbuilding is a demanding craft. You can’t just take a few boards and nail them together. I will show you some tricks if you help me. Right now some coins might help.
SPCX353*#*My friend Erik plans some sea exploration to the west. He will need a fast and sturdy ship for that. We have a lot of work before us. I might even pay you for it.
SPCX354*#*The main material we need is wood. The best type of wood is pine or oak. Make sure it is not infested with woodworms, or the ship will not hold for long.
SPCX355*#*Only the two of us would build the ship for years. We need some workers to do the manual work for us. Of course, you can nail on a plank or two as well.
SPCX356*#*My ships are perfect due to my insuperable shipbuilding skills but also thanks to the blessing of Odin, our highest god. So you better build him a shrine near the docks.
SPCX357*#*Now that we have the shrine you can make an offering. Food or gold is always a good choice. But I guess you would like to keep the gold for yourself.
SPCX358*#*With Odin’s blessing we will build a magnificent ship that won’t sink easily. Now go buy fabric for sails. We will need it soon.
SPCX359*#*The ship’s hull is ready. Now it’s time to build the main mast on which the sails will be fastened. Bring some more of that oak wood, it will be perfect for this.
SPCX360*#*Don’t you find that our workers are too slow? They are either lazy or don’t have the proper tools. Hammers, saws, tongs bring them all. They better not dawdle anymore.
SPCX361*#*I have a great idea! Let’s use some of our shields for the ship's deck. It will add a bit of color to the monotonous wooden pattern. Take the ones men don't use anymore.
SPCX362*#*A great shipbuilder like me needs to have his own statue so that my men can be proud to work under me. The statue must be beautiful, so no need to make it realistic.
SPCX363*#*The ship’s prow will be adorned by a spectacular wooden dragon. Hire a skilled carpenter to make it. At least someone as skilled as me so expect it won’t be cheap.
SPCX364*#*The ship is ready to be set on water. We will move her from my workshop to the harbor. She is large and heavy so we will need a lot of men to help with that.
SPCX365*#*Is the dragon for the prow ready yet? No? Then take some cedar wood to the carpenter. I would like something more exotic for the main decoration.
SPCX366*#*Hmm. It seems to me the ship is still missing something. Maybe some more decorations. Do you still have some shields left?
SPCX367*#*Another masterpiece done! Sometimes I surprise myself with my genius. After such a good work we deserve a hearty meal. Go catch some nice tuna for us.
SPCX368*#*The ship is finished but my workshop is now empty. Help me resupply while you are still here. I have no nails left and they are important. You can start with that.
SPCX369*#*It’s always good to have some wood in reserve so I can start building right away. Or repair some damage on an older ship. Which is not very often as my ships are sturdy.
SPCX370*#*You are still far from a genius shipbuilder like me. But I think you got the basics. I am sure you can’t wait to go exploring. So one last task and you can go.
SPCX371*#*I heard that the ship is ready for our journey. Are you ready too? Go buy yourself some proper armor before we set of. And don’t forget the helmet.
SPCX372*#*The armor is good. Should spare you some wounds in case we meet unpleasant people along the way. Now you need an axe and a sword.
SPCX373*#*Last but not least a shield. My men could use some too. They mentioned that Floki took their old ones. Who knows what that old fox needed them for.
SPCX374*#*Actually this voyage is not completely voluntary. I was exiled. I might have done something hasty to deserve it. But finding a new land should redeem me I hope.
SPCX375*#*This land is barren and cold. No wonder it’s called Iceland. Let’s use this time to get warm by fire while we are on land. At sea we will have to make do without.
SPCX376*#*As an exile it’s not easy to find men who will sail with me. I trust you will be capable to round up more of them. Just promise them gold and new land to settle on.
SPCX377*#*They want gold upfront? Clever guys. Fine, give them some coins and promise them more after we return. That should motivate them during the voyage.
SPCX378*#*Floki built a shrine for Odin in the docks. He knows how important is our god’s blessing on the sea. That’s why we shall build a small shrine on the ship too.
SPCX379*#*I do not doubt Floki’s ability. But he is a bit too concentrated on the outside of the ship and has neglected the interior. The crew needs a few beds to sleep in.
SPCX380*#*I want no more problems with the authorities. As an exile I have to leave the country as soon as possible. Grab some food and let’s go.
SPCX381*#*I dropped my helmet into the sea as we boarded our ship. I just wanted to kiss my wife properly and so put it down. Quickly get a new one from the blacksmith!
SPCX382*#*Iceland is getting smaller in the distance. Now we just have to hope the land in front of us is not far. You can ready your shield in case we meet some enemies on the way.
SPCX383*#*The wind on the sea is freezing cold. I should have thought about warm clothing before we set off. But that’s what you are here for. Go and buy us some furs.
SPCX384*#*I have heard stories about a land to the west before. According to them we should not be far anymore. You can prepare some materials to build the settlement.
SPCX385*#*There is something a bit away from our course. Looks like land. I will send a few men to go and investigate it while we continue on.
SPCX386*#*Just as I thought, it is land. But it doesn’t seem very hospitable. Let’s continue along the coast to the west. You can catch some fish while I concentrate on navigation.
SPCX387*#*We should go and take a look around the shore. Make some firewood ready so we can warm ourselves once we investigate a bit.
SPCX388*#*The land here looks similar to our home. Not what I hoped for. But it’s not inhabited so we can make a settlement here. Buy some tools so we can start building.
SPCX389*#*There is something white in the distance coming closer. Probably a wild animal. We better ready our weapons in case it is hungry.
SPCX390*#*It was a polar bear and it was hungry. But a few hits with our shields and it run off. Unfortunately some shields are broken now, we have to get new ones.
SPCX391*#*This land here seems like a good place for a village. Let’s start with a farm for me and my family. Once I bring them with me from home everything needs to be ready.
SPCX392*#*The main walls of the house are standing. But we are nowhere near done and a month has already passed. We could build the settlement faster with more men.
SPCX393*#*Unfortunately there are not many trees on this island. We will need to trade for wood. I trust you with this issue. We will need wood for the roof and doors.
SPCX394*#*I will call this land Greenland. People will be attracted to come here if it has a favorable name. And we want many settlers for our new village.
SPCX395*#*Now that the settlement is built we can go explore the land and sea here. I have a mind to catch some seals in the nearby fjord. Get us some seal bait.
SPCX396*#*I have seen some whales in the water near the fjord. It will be challenging but worth it. We will need some special equipment to catch them. Bring some big harpoons.
SPCX397*#*I can’t wait to tell my wife about the new land where we can live. I will be the lord here and no one will exile me again. Gather our men and let’s go.
SPCX398*#*We should check the ship and repair it if necessary before embarking on the way home. It would be truly unfortunate if we sink on the way back.
SPCX399*#*I have seen some gemstones in the river nearby. Take some of them as a souvenir for my wife. She will love them.
SPCX400*#*The way home went by much faster. Now pay my men for their service as I promised. We might need them soon again when we return to Greenland.
SPCX401*#*My father mentioned you. He told me about the time when you discovered Greenland together. You have some shields as a memento, right? Can you show them to me?
SPCX402*#*I’ve been living in Greenland half my life after father brought us here. We have our freedom but the weather is harsh. Gather some wood for fire and I will tell you more.
SPCX403*#*One of our sailors, Bjarni returned home after a year of roaming the seas. He says there is land west from here with trees and pastures. I have to see this for myself.
SPCX404*#*My father Erik wanted to find a fertile land for us but he failed. I will now fulfill his dream. Go ask some villagers if they would embark with me on this journey.
SPCX405*#*Good relationships with your crew are essential on a long voyage. No viking has ever said no to some roasted fish and ale. Bonding over a dinner is always easier.
SPCX406*#*My father’s ship is still in good shape. Just a bit of obligatory maintenance and she is good to go. Floki’s craft is truly magnificent.
SPCX407*#*Mother bid me to help her rebuild the stable behind the house. However I have no time for that now. Could you lend her a hand instead? I would be very grateful.
SPCX408*#*We are ready to go. Just buy yourself a warm coat before we set off. The northern wind can freeze you to the bone.
SPCX409*#*There was a whale, it appeared over the water for a moment. A magnificent creature. We have no time to catch it, but some fishing equipment might still come in handy.
SPCX410*#*I think I can see land in the distance already. Let’s get closer and inspect the beach. We can also try out the fishing gear. There are many fish in the water.
SPCX411*#*There are signs of campfires on the shore. The land is obviously inhabited. Ready your weapons and shields in case the natives are not friendly.
SPCX412*#*One of our men got lost. Maybe the natives have captured him. We have to send out a searching party. I hope they find him alive and well.
SPCX413*#*Fool! Scaring me like that. Nothing happened to him he just wandered in the woods and found some grapes. This is indeed a fruitful land. Let’s build here some shelters.
SPCX414*#*This is a wonderful place to live and farm. The soil is fertile, the weather pleasant and I have not seen so many trees in my life. Let’s call it Vinland after the grapes.
SPCX415*#*There are some people that attacked us in the middle of the night. They killed some of my men. We need to be alert! Bring our weapons and make sure they are sharp.
SPCX416*#*I don't want to live in fear of an attack at any time. We could try to offer natives some gold, but we need some shields to protect us.
SPCX417*#*They did not accept the gold. They were looking like they don’t even know what it is. I must think about this problematic situation. I have always better ideas while eating.
SPCX418*#*Send the men to gather some grapes. It’s too cold for them to grow in Greenland so it will be a wonderful gift for my family at home.
SPCX419*#*We should return home. Let’s pack our ship full of timber and grapes and go. I will tell my father about Vinland and we might return sometime later.
SPCX420*#*Greenland is already visible on the horizon. It’s cold with lots of ice and snow but it is good to be home. I am grateful for your help and farewell, sailor.
SPCX421*#*My name is Bartolomeu Dias, a seasoned navigator from Portugal. I need to ask for your help. My ship has sustained some damage in a storm and I am missing wood for repairs.
SPCX422*#*I was purchasing marble in a nearby port. Right now I am sailing home with the cargo but unfortunately my food reserves are almost empty.
SPCX423*#*You are a real savior, friend! I was lucky to meet you at the sea. Perhaps we can help each other out even further. Will you help me collect marble for our stonemasons?
SPCX424*#*I see you are quite resourceful. If you also know where to get some good iron, it can be sold for a great price in Portugal. So don’t hesitate to bring me some.
SPCX425*#*The port of Lisbon is not far now. If you mean to accompany me you should prepare a bit of gold for the docking fee. It’s not cheap in my home town.
SPCX426*#*Lisbon is a beautiful city. I'm sure you will fall in love with it just like me. We will need help unloading our cargo now. If you have some strong men send them to help.
SPCX427*#*So I want to invite you for dinner at my house. It’s customary to bring a gift. My wife loves chocolate, you will certainly make her happy with such a sweet present.
SPCX428*#*We will have chicken, beef or pork for dinner. If you prefer fish I am afraid you have to get your own. We missed the morning fish market and I eat only fresh fish.
SPCX429*#*My wife took a liking to you as well. I am sure you noticed. She bid me to ask you if you would help us furnish the room for the baby we are expecting.
SPCX430*#*You have found beautiful furniture. Missing is only a cozy fireplace. Even though Lisbon is pretty warm most of the year, the winters can be freezing.
SPCX431*#*While you were busy with the fireplace a messenger came. The king wants to see us. Buy us some nice clothes so we don’t look shabby before His Highness.
SPCX432*#*Don’t forget to give up your weapons before going to the king. The guards won’t let anyone armed near His Highness. The security is really tight.
SPCX433*#*So the king gave me an important task. To lead an expedition around Africa and to find a mythical king Prester John with whom he wishes to make an alliance.
SPCX434*#*There is also a second reason to this voyage. We should find a new way to the Indies. I am hoping you will join me on this journey. You and your men too.
SPCX435*#*My job here in the port is taking care of the royal warehouses. It looks like we will be gone for a long time so the warehouse must be in top condition when we leave.
SPCX436*#*We have strengthened the walls of the warehouse. Now to patch up the roof. Bring some wooden shingles and my men will do the rest.
SPCX437*#*Someone needs to watch the warehouse while I am gone. I have entrusted my friend to take care of it. As this is a regular job he should be paid for it.
SPCX438*#*I have already told you about the morning fish market. I have a friend fisherman there. He has had a streak of bad luck recently and caught no fish. Let’s help him a bit.
SPCX439*#*I see you are at least as competent fisherman as you are a good sailor. Maybe if we get a new fishing equipment for my friend he will have better luck again too.
SPCX440*#*Chocolate has become quite popular in the city lately. The people have bought it all and my wife can’t find any in the shops. Could you perhaps get her some again?
SPCX441*#*The stonemasons for whom I collected marble have contacted me with a request for more materials. They still need more marble to finish the monument for our king.
SPCX442*#*It’s time we start preparing for our journey. I have my loyal men, but I plan to sail with  three ships so I will need more. We want only skilled and experienced sailors.
SPCX443*#*I’ll take my own ship São Cristóvão and two ships that were given to me by the king. My ship is in perfect state but the king’s ships could use a bit of maintenance.
SPCX444*#*Now I have a special task for you. I need a new compass and it can’t be a cheap toy. You are a seasoned sailor so I hope you can buy me the right one.
SPCX445*#*I know a great cook who could join our crew. He has only one request: a well equipped kitchen. All the kitchen equipment should be from metal so it won’t break easily.
SPCX446*#*The kitchen is equipped. Now we just need food. I will get some salted meat and you get dried fish. We will have to buy other food on the road so it won’t get spoiled.
SPCX447*#*I received some bad news from home. Our cellar has caved in. Fortunately nobody is hurt. But the damage needs to be removed. Can you help me with the reconstruction?
SPCX448*#*The ships are in good condition and ready to set sails. Now we just need a few small boats that can be used to explore shallow waters and for fishing.
SPCX449*#*Some of my men are feeling sick. I am afraid they won’t be able to join us on the journey. We need a replacement for them and quickly!
SPCX450*#*We are ready to go now. I should have taken some chocolate with me. It would remind me of my wife’s sweet chocolate cake. Do you have some by any chance?
SPCX451*#*Let’s turn south and sail for the western coast of Africa. I can’t wait to buy some exotic fruit there. Prepare a few coins so we can buy bananas and mangoes.
SPCX452*#*Do you see the village on the beach? Let’s stop there and try to trade for food. I am a bit nervous about meeting the natives.  A few weapons would make me feel more safe.
SPCX453*#*I was afraid for nothing. The local people are friendly and willing to trade with us. However, they don’t like our coins. We will have to pay with some precious stones.
SPCX454*#*Now that we are supplied with fresh fruit and vegetables I would like to enjoy a tasty meal. If you could also catch some fish it would be a perfect dinner.
SPCX455*#*There are some men in the sea clinging to a piece of wood. Their ship must have had an accident. Let’s send a boat for them and take them on board.
SPCX456*#*The rescued men say their ship sunk in a storm. There can be some more sailors alive after this unfortunate accident. Take some men and try looking around.
SPCX457*#*We have found more sailors. We don’t have enough place on our ships to take them with us. Let’s leave them in a village with some money so they can return home.
SPCX458*#*Now we can continue in our voyage. But first we should replenish our supplies. Could you also bring me more of the chocolate? I’ve already eaten it all.
SPCX459*#*I see a storm not far from us. It looks like a real beast. We should nail all equipment to the ships so we don’t lose it in the storm. But I didn't take any nails with me.
SPCX460*#*All of our ships got away without any serious damage. Still small repairs will be necessary. I have some nails left, but I will also need a few planks for the repairs.
SPCX461*#*The western wind should take us in the right direction. If we find land I would like to trade with the villagers again. Can you get me more of the precious stones?
SPCX462*#*We are near the coast again. Let’s look around on the shore for a village or a settlement. Some food might serve well to befriend the local people.
SPCX463*#*Surprisingly this beautiful beach seems uninhabited. Let’s search the jungle and maybe we will find a village after all. I'll go this way and you send some men that way.
SPCX464*#*There were no people only wild monkeys. They attacked us thinking we have some food. Throw my chocolate at them, they might get distracted and leave us alone.
SPCX465*#*I had to throw my coin pouch at the monkeys and thankfully the shiny gold caught their attention. Unfortunately I am broke now. Can you lend me some money?
SPCX466*#*The cook has come to complain to me. The kitchenware has gone rusty. These are the risks of metal equipment. We will need some new one if we want to eat well again.
SPCX467*#*Now that the kitchen is equipped once more we should make use of it and prepare a lunch for my crew. Every sailor loves fish. So let’s catch us a few fresh ones.
SPCX468*#*That’s a lot of fish you have caught. Even if the crew eats until they are full we won’t be able to eat them all now. We will need a few barrels to store them in.
SPCX469*#*I’ve been thinking about meeting this mythical king we were sent to find. We can make a small statue of our king for him so he knows with whom he shall make an alliance.
SPCX470*#*You have brought a lot of stone. Take some men to help you bring it on my ship and we can get to work. I am no master stonemason but I will do my best.
SPCX471*#*Before I can start working on the sculpture I will need some tools. I am sure people in Africa make statues too. Try looking for the tools in the nearest village.
SPCX472*#*Who would have thought making a statue is so difficult? This looks more like a tree stump than our king. Please hire a sculptor from the village to make the statue for us.
SPCX473*#*My men are complaining. They say we have been sailing for too long and still no mythical king or Indies on the horizon. I will try to placate them with some nice dinner.
SPCX474*#*The crew won’t relent. So I made a deal with them. Three more days sailing and then we turn back. Prepare a boat for me in case they decide to throw me overboard anyway.
SPCX475*#*This is as far as we go, even though we didn't reach our goal. Let’s leave the statue of our king here. Make a pedestal for it so it can be seen from the sea.
SPCX476*#*I must admit I am a bit sad we had to turn around and go home. It will be hard to stand before my king. There is a storm again before us. Get our men to prepare for it.
SPCX477*#*That must be the southernmost part of the continent. Cape of Storms would be an accurate name for it. Can you fetch me a spyglass so I can inspect it?
SPCX478*#*We will be home soon. It would be good to at least bring something from the journey. Let’s buy some spices and items from the natives to show how far we ventured.
SPCX479*#*I am a bit nervous to tell the king about my failure. Let’s eat something before we set off to see him. A good meal always makes me calm down.
SPCX480*#*The king was not angry at all. He even promised to make a statue built in my honor. He said that the southern land should be called Cape of Good Hope. It sounds better.
SPCX481*#*We are not open yet, but do come in. I will show you around. For a small fee you can see the most wondrous gadgets in this country. Come, follow me!
SPCX482*#*Do you see this singing wall clock? Fascinating, right? I made all of these things myself. Be careful of the loose planks on the floor. I should have them exchanged.
SPCX483*#*I can see that you like my inventions. So I have a proposition for you. Let’s work together on them. We should talk about the details over some hot food.
SPCX484*#*Usually I am quite busy constructing gadgets or engraving. I could use someone to help me gather the materials and necessary tools. I always need a lot of metal for them.
SPCX485*#*Come, look at this beautiful fountain. It is still in my workshop because it’s not yet finished. I just need some more marble for the statue at the top.
SPCX486*#*The wall clock has to be installed on the church tower. It is ready for some time now but it is quite heavy and I had no one to help me carry it there.
SPCX487*#*I often work late into the night. I am undisturbed and can better concentrate on my work. The only problem is a proper light. A few candles might come in handy.
SPCX488*#*I am not just an inventor but I also like to make engravings. Usually I engrave buildings but if you want I could make a portrait of you. Bring a chair and sit down.
SPCX489*#*I don’t want to sound conceited but I think the engraving ended up nicely. If you want it, bring me a few coins and it will be yours. As my friend you will get a discount.
SPCX490*#*My wife does the shopping in our household. However, she does not know where to buy fresh fish. I don’t want to tell her to make her feel sad but they are always foul.
SPCX491*#*My next invention will be a magnetic chandelier. It will serve to hang pots and ladles. It will be a perfect addition to any kitchen. Let’s get the material for it.
SPCX492*#*The chandelier will be a practical item but I can also make it a piece of art with a few colorful gemstones. They will make beautiful colored reflections on the walls.
SPCX493*#*I can’t wait to try out my latest creation. Get me some candles to complete the chandelier and we can hang it above the table in the kitchen.
SPCX494*#*The chandelier sure looks great but I might have overdone it with the ornamentation. It’s too heavy for me to lift. Can you get some help so we can hang it on the ceiling?
SPCX495*#*The entry fee into my House of Wonders is not nearly enough to cover all my costs. I will need to get a job. Maybe I could get into the merchant business.
SPCX496*#*We can start working on another addition to my collection of wonders. It will be a special barrel that will serve my visitors hot and cold drinks.
SPCX497*#*The pipes for the wonderful barrel and the main bowl for warming up the water have to be made from metal. The construction of such a gadget is no easy task.
SPCX498*#*I should start my merchant career with something simple and easily obtained. You seem to be a competent fisher, so how about we get into the fish trade?
SPCX499*#*Now that we have the goods we can open up a shop. We can use our old barn in the backyard. It just needs a bit of renovation and it will become a decent shop.
SPCX500*#*Missing is just a big sign over the door with the text Henry’s Fabulous Fish and some lamps to lighten up the inside. It’s dark as the bottom of the sea now.
SPCX501*#*There is still one thing we have to resolve. I have no time to serve as a shopkeeper and my wife has lots of work around the house. We will need to hire a cashier.
SPCX502*#*The shop is open, the fish are fresh yet our profit is low. Maybe we should extend our assortment by some fishing equipment to attract more customers.
SPCX503*#*Still not many customers shop here. If our shop seems full of people more customers might come. Send for your men and tell them to stroll around and browse our wares.
SPCX504*#*At last our business is booming. We have already sold out most of our goods, we need to replenish stock. Make sure the fish are fresh so we keep our good reputation.
SPCX505*#*Now that we have enough finances and our business is prospering we can expand further. Let’s buy a few ships so we can trade with more goods from other countries.
SPCX506*#*I wish we had more money for new ships but even these old ones will do. If we exchange the rotten planks for new, we can sail them without worries.
SPCX507*#*The ships have already set sail. I sent them to Spain to buy southern vine and fruits. In the meantime we should enlarge our storage so all the new goods will fit in.
SPCX508*#*Our ships have arrived unexpectedly early at night. Something must have happened. Take some candles with you so I won’t trip in the dark and let’s go to the harbor.
SPCX509*#*The ships hit rocks in the sea and two were wrecked. Why are the rocks not marked? I am going to ask the local authorities about this. Call a coach for me.
SPCX510*#*The rocks need to be marked so that no more ships end up at the bottom of the sea there. Seems no one is willing to build a lighthouse on the reef so I’ll do it myself.
SPCX511*#*I have never built a lighthouse before. But how hard can it be? We should start with planning over some hot meal. You bring the food and I will bring pen and paper.
SPCX512*#*It’s important to get some insight on a problem from other concerned persons. Go for sailors from the harbor and let’s ask them about the dangerous rocks in the sea.
SPCX513*#*From what I have heard I know quite a lot about the reef. But seeing it for myself will be best. Prepare a boat that will take us there.
SPCX514*#*The reef is indeed dangerous. We were almost wrecked too when we got close. You start gathering material for the base of the lighthouse and I will make a sketch of it.
SPCX515*#*I have already thrown out a dozen sketches. They were not acceptable. Bring me some candles, the sun is already setting and I can hardly see the paper.
SPCX516*#*The sketch is done and we are ready to start. We will need to hire workers to build the lighthouse. I will choose the men, you worry only about their wage.
SPCX517*#*I believe you got the stone already? Good. The men can start building the basement. We’ll need iron anchorage bars that will keep the building fastened to the rocks.
SPCX518*#*How is the work progressing? Can we concentrate on the tower now? The main part of the lighthouse will be from wood. I will leave you to take care of the material.
SPCX519*#*The men are doing a good job. Even in a storm they worked. Bring them some food to lighten their mood. I am sure it will make them happy.
SPCX520*#*The men have enjoyed the dinner but still a few of them left, saying that it was too perilous to work on the rocks. We will have to find replacement for them.
SPCX521*#*Double the worker’s pay. It is a dangerous work so we need to pay them properly. Also we can't let any more of them leave. The lighthouse needs to be finished soon.
SPCX522*#*The wooden structure seems a bit fragile to me now. Maybe we could build a central stone pillar in the tower. The lighthouse will easier withstand the stormy waters.
SPCX523*#*As an engineer I know how important are good tools. Proper hammers would certainly make the work on the lighthouse easier. The old ones are pretty worn down.
SPCX524*#*The essential part of any lighthouse is the lantern room and the source of light itself. For this purpose we will use candles, easy to use and obtain.
SPCX525*#*At the moment I am taking the workers to the building site with my ships. But they should be able to travel even without my help. So let’s build them a few boats.
SPCX526*#*They fly a French flag. Our country is not at the best terms with France now. Let’s try a friendly welcome along with some food and we might avoid potential difficulties.
SPCX527*#*You are my only connection to home. Please try to smuggle me some lockpicks in here so I can open the handcuffs and the cell while we are still sailing.
SPCX528*#*I regret now never to have tried the burglar career. Picking locks is difficult. You must send someone to rescue me. Don’t try to do it alone or they will get you too.
SPCX529*#*I think we are near French coast now. Maybe they want to ransom me. Prepare some gold for such a case. I must get back to my wife and my lighthouse as soon as possible.
SPCX530*#*I am lucky that the French king is such a reasonable man. He let me go right away. Can you send a ship for me? I need to hurry back to my work on the lighthouse.
SPCX531*#*The barbarians have destroyed what I have built so far. But don’t think I will be discouraged by this. Bring the granite we used before and let’s start over!
SPCX532*#*They took the candles too. Or maybe threw them into the sea. Who knows. We will have to get new ones. They burn down quickly so bring as many as you can.
SPCX533*#*The work on the lighthouse, the kidnapping and then the destruction of my work have left me exhausted. I need some time off. Come, join me for a peaceful dinner at my home.
SPCX534*#*We must prevent any more unpleasant visits like before. Take a few men to patrol the waters nearby while we still work on the lighthouse.
SPCX535*#*The building of a lighthouse is no cheap work. I have already spent all my savings even though I received some funds especially for the lighthouse.
SPCX536*#*Remember, these are stormy waters. Make sure the outer walls are nailed properly lest a strong wind takes them away. The stone core will serve as a good support for them.
SPCX537*#*There will be a lighthouse keeper to keep watch and change the candles once they burn down. We built him small living quarters. Now we just need to furnish them.
SPCX538*#*Pack some food into the storage for the lighthouse keeper. He won’t be able to leave too often so it’s best that he has enough food to eat even for a longer stay.
SPCX539*#*The lighthouse is ready to shine. Just build a small stone pier at the base where boats can anchor and we are done here. Can't keep tying down the boats to a rock.
SPCX540*#*This is my masterpiece! I am sure the lighthouse will prevail even the greatest storm that ever was. Just fill the storage with candles so the light will keep on shining.
SPCX541*#*I have been looking for you. We have work to do again. The lighthouse has sustained some damage during winter and I need your help getting it back in shape.
SPCX542*#*I have heard there is a great storm coming. I plan to prove the endurance of my masterpiece by staying here while it blows over. So let’s go strengthen the walls.
SPCX543*#*Our lighthouse keeper has heard of the storm too and is afraid. He doesn’t know how well the lighthouse is built. But let’s pay him off so he can leave if he wishes so.
SPCX544*#*The great storm could last for days so we better prepare now. We need food and water. I believe that the water barrels are still full so concentrate on the food.
SPCX545*#*I see lightning in the distance already. Quick, bring more men to finish the repairs before the storm arrives. I will do the finishing touches myself.
SPCX546*#*The men have already left. Now I need to light the candles in the lantern room in case some unlucky ship gets blown to the reef. I am not sure if I have enough of them.
SPCX547*#*The splashing waves reach over the roof of the lighthouse and some water is already leaking in under the door. We need to barricade the door with sandbags.
SPCX548*#*The whole lighthouse is creaking under the blasts of wind and water. Maybe this was not such a good idea to stay here. Help me nail in some boards to the windows.
SPCX549*#*The lighthouse will not hold. We must leave. Be careful and anchor your ship some distance away from the reef so you will not get thrown on the rocks.
SPCX550*#*Have you seen what happened to the lighthouse? It’s all gone. You saved my life. I can never thank you enough. Now I just want to eat something warm and retire.
SPCX551*#*You must be new in the Caribbean waters. I can see it on your pale looks. Prepare some chairs for me and my men and let’s have a talk on your ship.
SPCX552*#*As you might have noticed, I am not from here either. My name is Edward Vernon, captain in His Majesty’s Royal Navy. Currently I am out fishing. Care to join me?
SPCX553*#*It’s not long that I have been appointed the Commodore of Jamaica. Lots of work here with the Spanish prowling the seas. Sometimes only weapons can keep them at bay.
SPCX554*#*Come with me to Kingston. You can replenish your supplies and stock up on rum. We also use it for the rum ration on our ships. Just prepare some crates for the goods.
SPCX555*#*If you have still some stone ballast in your ship you should discard it here. Clear up the cargo hold so you have enough free space for the goods you purchase in Jamaica.
SPCX556*#*You might have wondered why have I approached you. Hereabouts it’s just the Spanish and pirates and I need a reliable supplier. I would also like to know your crew.
SPCX557*#*There is a good merchant on Cuba. However, Cuba belongs to the Spanish so I can no longer trade with him. But you should go and see what he has to offer.
SPCX558*#*Magin is an able merchant with good wares. Stop by him from time to time. Now that you have brought the lemons from him we should make use of them and fry some fish.
SPCX559*#*We have still some leftover lemons. I will give you a good advice. Pack them into casks and keep them during long voyages. It does wonders to keep your crew healthy.
SPCX560*#*I am still trying to get settled here in Jamaica. The construction of my residence is underway. If you could help, I am sure it would be finished much faster.
SPCX561*#*The Spanish won’t let us rest. They caught captain Jenkins and cut his ear off. The Royal navy won’t suffer such an insult! Restock the munition and let’s go!
SPCX562*#*Could you send some men to help prepare my ships? The news was unexpected and half my crew is still dawdling somewhere in the city. They will get into trouble for this.
SPCX563*#*We sail for the coast of Panama. They are holding captain Jenkins there. In the hurry I forgot to prepare provisions. Take care of it. The men need to eat even in battle.
SPCX564*#*The Spanish flag is clear on the ships before us. Men, prepare for battle! You better keep your distance until this is finished. A naval battle is a dangerous business.
SPCX565*#*We won! That will teach them cutting off any part of a British citizen’s body. Get us some barrels of rum and give the men an extra tot. They earned it.
SPCX566*#*I am all for giving out the rum ration but after our last victory the crew got quite rowdy. Anyway, let’s concentrate now on repairing the ships. We need nails and tools.
SPCX567*#*We have used a lot of munition to win this battle. We will need some ship ballast for the way back to Jamaica. I would be anxious to sail with such an empty ship.
SPCX568*#*I need to leave a few men in Panama so the Spanish won’t be able to reclaim it without resistance. But I can’t leave here as many as I would like to.
SPCX569*#*I decided I'll adjust the rum ration on my ships. If we dilute the rum with water the men will not get drunk so fast. Let’s add some lemon juice too for a better taste.
SPCX570*#*We should make a surprise attack on Cuba while the Spanish don’t suspect anything. Let’s quickly resupply in Kingston. You take care of the food.
SPCX571*#*The diluted rum or grog became popular among my crew. They are using my nickname, Old Grog. Now that the crew is sober they will repair the ships in no time.
SPCX572*#*We are almost ready for the new campaign in Cuba. We just need more cutlasses and pistols. Some have gotten over board in the battle at Panama.
SPCX573*#*We don’t have enough ships to perform a direct attack on Santiago de Cuba. We will have to blockade the port. Meanwhile you try to infiltrate the city as a stone merchant.
SPCX574*#*A merchant ship is closing in. Her captain could persuade the governor to surrender. Let’s have a talk with him and greet him with a glass of grog with fresh lemon juice.
SPCX575*#*Facundo, the Cuban merchant seems like a reasonable man. I have sent him on with a message for the governor of the city. Send a few of your men with him in disguise.
SPCX576*#*Seems the governor won’t take up my gracious offer. Facundo left me some of his rum. Let’s try it with our dinner tonight. It tastes better than our liquor.
SPCX577*#*The governor called the Spanish navy for help. When I see the size of their fleet it’s clear we stand little chance in winning this. Let’s weigh the anchor and leave.
SPCX578*#*I have a feeling that after my last unsuccessful campaign I will be called back home soon. I would, at least, present my fleet in the best condition possible.
SPCX579*#*There are still some victories I would like to be remembered by when I leave. A respectable statue in the town would serve this purpose.
SPCX580*#*The message from London came in this morning. Back to the rainy weather of the British isles it is. Let me enjoy the perfect taste of ripe lemons once more before I leave.
SPCX581*#*Welcome to Cuba, captain! The island of fine cigars and strong rum. Come, let’s enjoy a tasty meal and I will introduce myself.
SPCX582*#*I have made my home here after I left Spain. I just opened a new shop in Santiago. I could use a partner to help me get started. I am still missing some equipment.
SPCX583*#*I want to concentrate on selling traditional products like rum and sugar. I have already bought enough goods, just help me build a few more shelves to place the wares on.
SPCX584*#*My brother Magin has a general store with everything we might need. So if you don’t know where to obtain some items, just go to him. He surely has the right bottles too.
SPCX585*#*My family hid in the cellar and thankfully nobody is hurt. But the earthquake has disturbed the walls of my shop. We have to make some repairs before we can open up again.
SPCX586*#*Seems more troubles appeared. A cholera plague has broken out in the city. Send some men to take care of the store for me. I can’t risk getting my family infected.
SPCX587*#*With the sickness in town I am afraid to buy food for me and my family here. Could you go and catch some fresh fish out on the sea?
SPCX588*#*The sickness is spreading. I better take my family back to Spain for a while. Let’s pack our things into crates and go. I will leave the shop in the hands of my brother.
SPCX589*#*I think it’s time to return. The cholera must be gone by now. We are merchants but with so many pirates in the Caribbean we should have some weapons on us.
SPCX590*#*The store is closed and deserted. Go to my brother’s shop and ask him what has happened. While you are there take some bottles of rum. I have a feeling I will need them.
SPCX591*#*With the epidemic in town the business got quite bad and my brother had to close the shop. We will have to start over. Let me think about our options over a hot meal.
SPCX592*#*My wife inherited a house not long ago. If we renovate it we could use it to start a new shop. There is a tenant Mr. Boutellier at the moment. I will speak with him.
SPCX593*#*Mr. Boutellier has an interesting idea. Distilling our own rum in the old house. He has some experience with it. Let’s send him some men to help with the equipment.
SPCX594*#*The distillation equipment is from Mr. Boutellier. It’s a bit old but still functional. We can start with that. We are almost ready just get some barrels for the final product.
SPCX595*#*We can start the production as soon as we get the ingredients. There is lots of good sugar cane on Cuba. I believe my brother Magin sells some in his shop too.
SPCX596*#*The first tries were not very successful. It’s no better than the usual harsh stuff you can get anywhere. We need something special. Maybe a new equipment would help.
SPCX597*#*If we use a special kind of yeast it could give the spirit the right flavor. I know where to find what we need. But it will cost us not just money but precious stones too.
SPCX598*#*The new yeast surely helped the rum become more refined. Come, taste it for yourself! But be careful, it’s strong stuff. Better eat something first.
SPCX599*#*The more opinions we have, the better. Bring some sailors from the harbor to sample our product. I am sure they will be happy for this opportunity.
SPCX600*#*We are on the right track but still far from finished. Let’s try to remove the impurities by filtering it with charcoal. We must be careful not to remove the fine taste.
SPCX601*#*We need to experiment a bit. Let’s try some new ingredients. I will take care of that, you bring more sugar cane. We have already used up all of our supplies.
SPCX602*#*Neighbors have been complaining. We should probably move the distillery away from the residential area. I have seen a suitable warehouse at the outskirts of the town.
SPCX603*#*I have been wondering how to improve the distillation process. How about we use a pot still instead of a column still? I have a feeling it will be much better.
SPCX604*#*A friend has gifted us a palm tree sapling. My son Emilio planted it in front of the distillery, it should bring us prosperity. We have to at least invite him for dinner.
SPCX605*#*A quality rum needs to be aged not just drunk straight from the still. We will store the liquor in oak barrels which should result in a smoother taste and golden color.
SPCX606*#*A few months have passed and I think it’s ready. This is the rum that will be known all around the world. Let’s fill a few bottles with it and try to sell it in town.
SPCX607*#*We will present our new rum at a small party at our home. I have invited merchants and influential people in town. You can call some of your friends too.
SPCX608*#*Seeing the bats living under the roof of our distillery gave me an idea. Every product needs it’s own mark and logo. Let’s imprint a picture of a bat on our bottles.
SPCX609*#*Let’s build a larger storage near the distillery where we can put the barrels with rum that still needs to mature. After that we can start the production for real.
SPCX610*#*We made it. Come drink with me. Nothing beats drinking nice rum while sitting on the terrace in the shade of a palm tree. Bring something to eat too.
SPCX611*#*Our rum is selling well. People love it. We should expand beyond the borders of Cuba. Let’s build a ship which can sail out with our rum into the world.
SPCX612*#*Our rum may be perfect but we need to develop new products to keep the demand steady. Go and ask our customers what we could do to improve.
SPCX613*#*You can drink our rum straight but it would be also perfect in mixed drinks. We will try something new. Let’s use a fruit we have plentiful here on Cuba - the coconuts.
SPCX614*#*The rum is well liked also outside of Cuba. We will need to build a new distillery to cover all the demand. We could open the second factory in Bermudas.
SPCX615*#*The quality of rum must not decline. That’s why we will build the distillation apparatus ourselves to fit exactly all our needs. Now go and get the materials for it.
SPCX616*#*Before we open the new distillery I want to make a banquet to present our company. We will also offer the new drink I am still working on. You take care of the catering.
SPCX617*#*We will need some tables and chairs for the banquet. Pick something nice to impress our guests. Leave the decorations to my wife. She will love to take care of this task.
SPCX618*#*While you have been busy with our new distillery I have come up with a delicious drink. I call it the Piña Colada. Bring me more coconuts so I can make you some.
SPCX619*#*How about we build a small bar near the distillery where we will serve our rum and cocktails mixed from it? I am sure a lot of people would like that.
SPCX620*#*Just complete the fence around the outskirts and the new distillery will be ready for the grand opening. Then we can enjoy a glass of rum to celebrate our success.
SPCX621*#*Yes, you! I need your help. Come here so I don’t have to shout. Close the door and put some furniture in front of it so we are not disturbed. This is a delicate matter.
SPCX622*#*You were sailing the Caribbean waters looking a bit lost. So I thought I might give you a job. But first get some food on the table. I don’t like to talk with empty belly.
SPCX623*#*I had a business here and now I need to transport some cargo back to England. I can't fit it all into my ship. But I will need some assurance that it is safe with you.
SPCX624*#*Good, that is enough assurance for now. If you have your ships full of rocks or something, just deposit it here. We can continue after you have cleared some space.
SPCX625*#*You will be transporting a cargo with high demand on the virtues of the crew. And by that I mean gold. Get your men here so we can talk. I'm a good judge of character.
SPCX626*#*They don’t look like thieves. But appearance can deceive. So the gold will be locked in iron chests with heavy locks. And the key will be with me at all times.
SPCX627*#*Get your ships ready. Finish any repairs needed and let’s set sail. We will bring the gold on board after dark. We don’t want the Spanish to get a whiff of it.
SPCX628*#*It’s all completely legal. The Queen Elizabeth herself gave me her blessing. I don’t want to hear any complaints now. Here, shut your mouth with some food.
SPCX629*#*I see you have some treasures of your own. Put the precious stones in the chest too. They will be safe there. I will return them to you when we arrive, no worries.
SPCX630*#*The Lord Admiral is expecting the report of my mission. Let’s not leave him waiting. Let’s just pick up a special treat for him on our way. He loves good wine.
SPCX631*#*Back in London. I have to hurry to the Naval Offices to give my report. I am sure you can find a pleasant tavern to spend the evening in. Just have enough coin on you.
SPCX632*#*I've been given some time off. But I expect I'll be sent on a mission soon. If you want to join me I would be glad. For now you can make some upgrades on your ships here.
SPCX633*#*Gather your crew, the new mission is here. We are to sail around South America and explore the coast beyond. And as before, hinder the Spanish where possible.
SPCX634*#*We must have chosen the worst date to sail out. This storm is unbelievable. We have to turn back. My ship is already leaking. Some repairs will be necessary.
SPCX635*#*The voyage across Atlantic went well this time. However, it looks like one ship is rotting. We'll have to transfer the provisions to the remaining ships and burn her.
SPCX636*#*I must be sailing in the steps of Magellan because I too unearthed a plot to overthrow me. Let’s send the fools to the sea bottom with a large rock tied to their legs.
SPCX637*#*We will wait out the winter here. A fine wine will surely buy us the favour of the locals and make them a bit more relaxed. We don’t want them to attack us one morning.
SPCX638*#*The spring is here and we can continue. Still, the waters of Magellan’s Strait look dangerous. I hope you paid the insurance for our ships.
SPCX639*#*Well, the insurance will come in handy as only my flagship made the passage. But we shouldn’t lose hope. While we are still alive we can complete our mission.
SPCX640*#*What a beautiful catch! This Spanish ship was full of Chilean wine. And the wine is not bad. Order your men to carry it aboard. And watch them so they don’t drink it all.
SPCX641*#*And there I see another promising prey. The Spanish galleon wants to escape us but we won’t let them. Get rid of unnecessary cargo so we can pick up speed.
SPCX642*#*The ship is ours and the treasure inside too. Have you ever seen so much gold and jewels together? Let’s thank the Spanish captain for this gracious gift over a dinner.
SPCX643*#*I am almost sad to let her go, but we don’t have enough men to sail the Spanish galleon. So we will sink her. Fill her up with rocks so that she will go down faster.
SPCX644*#*We will let the captives go on the nearest inhabited island. Leave them some gold to purchase their way home. No one can call me heartless after this.
SPCX645*#*Let’s head north now. I hope we will encounter more treasure ships on our way. Have you salvaged some weapons from the Spanish? We could use them now.
SPCX646*#*A short stop on land will do us good. We will anchor here. Send a part of your crew to look around and the rest should build a camp. I can’t wait to sleep on solid ground.
SPCX647*#*While you were exploring we encountered the natives living on the coast. We couldn’t understand a thing they said but they gave us some food. Let’s return the favour.
SPCX648*#*As a captain I have the right for a better housing than the crew. And the mosquitos are making me insane. I need a temporary shack where I can sleep undisturbed.
SPCX649*#*This land is pleasant, the natives trusting, the perfect place to found a settlement. I have already chosen a few men to stay here. Leave them provisions for the start.
SPCX650*#*With this settlement I claim this land as the colony of England with the name Nova Albion. Engrave this into a stone on the beach to make it clear to all newcomers.
SPCX651*#*It’s time to continue our voyage. Crossing the Pacific is always risky so we must prepare for it accordingly. The natives should be willing to sell us the provisions.
SPCX652*#*We might spend the next few months on the ship until we encounter land. We'll need not only iron will but also discipline. There can’t be another mutiny while we sail.
SPCX653*#*I know the men feel good here and don’t want to spend months cramped in a ship again. But it’s time to leave. Go find them. I want them lined up on the deck in an hour.
SPCX654*#*You know what always works on sailors? Alcohol. Just give them some and they will cease their grumbling. I believe I still have some of the Chilean wine in my cabin.
SPCX655*#*How long are we sailing now? I have lost count. I even got sea sick after the last storm. Me, a seasoned sailor! What a shame. Maybe some food will settle my stomach.
SPCX656*#*Bring all the paddles and boards you can find! We hit a reef and now we are stuck. We need to free the ship from the rocks. Further away is a beach where we can anchor.
SPCX657*#*We are off the rocks now. But the ship is seriously damaged. Take away all the cargo we don’t need lest it drags us into the deep. Without it we should make it.
SPCX658*#*A few chests with gold have fallen through the breach in the hull. It hurts me to leave them here. Go back to the reef and look if you can find any of them still intact.
SPCX659*#*You have found some of the lost gold, I see. Well done! Now come and help us find a good anchoring spot for the ship. The ship will not stay on the surface much longer.
SPCX660*#*The damage is extensive but with the right materials and tools we can repair her. Take some men with you and go find the locals. Hopefully, they will be willing to help.
SPCX661*#*Here they are, looking savage as expected. Leave the negotiations to me. I'm quite good at foreign languages. You take care of the food for a feast after we strike a deal.
SPCX662*#*I had no doubts we would come to an understanding. The locals will provide all the tools we need. Just go cut down some trees for the planks and we can begin the repairs.
SPCX663*#*I promised the natives that we would transport the material for their new temple in return for their help. I know you have some experience with such a heavy cargo.
SPCX664*#*The ship is seaworthy again. Give the people some gold, they have been very helpful. Not just lending us tools but also working with us on the repairs. They deserve it.
SPCX665*#*Pack up your things, lads! We are leaving. Eat a fill of something nourishing while you can because soon you will be on the plain ship rations again.
SPCX666*#*Weight the anchor and set the course to Cape of Good Hope! That is our passage back home. This is a well known route and we should make it without any troubles now.
SPCX667*#*I must have been too excited to get on board again for I haven’t noticed we are missing some of our crew. Go back to the islands and find them. They are needed.
SPCX668*#*This is how I imagined our voyage. Blue sky, calm sea and strong wind carrying us forward. Today we will enjoy a dinner on the deck, my friend.
SPCX669*#*Stow the cargo into the casks, sweep the deck, fasten the sails. We want to look good when we sail into the port. A little bird told me the Queen herself will welcome us.
SPCX670*#*Before we enter the docks, go into the city and get me some new clothes. I can’t meet the Queen looking like a beggar. Green brocade fits me best.
SPCX671*#*You can call me Sir Francis from now on. What an honor to be a knight of Her Highness! Now let us oversee the unloading of the treasure chests. I don’t want to lose a coin!
SPCX672*#*All the men that endured this harsh voyage with us will get their share of the treasure. Make them line up so I can give each their gold and my thanks. They deserved both.
SPCX673*#*I have received a letter from the royal court that I am to be the new Mayor of Plymouth. The official gathering followed by a dinner will be tomorrow. You are invited.
SPCX674*#*I am famous now but that doesn’t mean I will shirk this job. I know just the thing Plymouth needs. A water tank that will serve as the water supply for the whole town.
SPCX675*#*I am a seaman and so I will probably return to sea soon. But every man needs a place to call home. So I have purchased a house in the country. Now just to furnish it.
SPCX676*#*My wife wants to make a party in our new home. I don’t care much for such social activities, but she can be persuasive. Just make sure we have some wine too.
SPCX677*#*You can come to the party too, of course. Just buy something suitable to wear. I have invited some important people now that I have been promoted so try to blend in.
SPCX678*#*Listen, we have more trouble with the Spanish. I know this is not your war, so I will not drag you into it. Just help me prepare and I won’t forget what I owe you.
SPCX679*#*Your crew is as capable as are yourself. If any of your men want to join the Royal Navy we will welcome them with open arms. I hope you won’t begrudge them for leaving.
SPCX680*#*This is it, my friend. Soon I will have to leave to battle the Spanish who dare attack us. But I can spare a moment to have one last dinner with you.
SPCX681*#*We are in a hurry. We need to get to Java before the month ends. If you don’t wanna aid me, stand aside. What? You think you can keep up? Then get your gear and let’s go.
SPCX682*#*I don’t respect just anyone, but you seem to be an adequate sailor. As I said, I am in a hurry. So if you could help me make my voyage smoother, I would reward you well.
SPCX683*#*We barely left the port and the crew is already moaning about the lack of food. I have no time to stop and shop for them. You go and fish out something to eat.
SPCX684*#*I pay them good money, yet they don’t follow my orders. This deck is not scrubbed properly! Get some competent sailors that will sail this ship like she deserves.
SPCX685*#*I may have made a mistake. I hoped to sail faster with no sailing ballast. But now I see the ship does not sit well in the water. Find me some stones we can use.
SPCX686*#*Our lookout spied a burning ship not far. The crew worries it is a bad sign. I don’t believe in such superstitions. But fill some barrels with sea water to calm them down.
SPCX687*#*The wind is unusually strong here threatening to tear our sails apart. I won’t be deterred by this! Nail down the sails so they won’t get loose in the wind and on we sail.
SPCX688*#*We are  sailing to Java, the famous spice island in the Indian ocean. I worry that I may not have enough gold to purchase all the spice I planned to buy.
SPCX689*#*Hold on tight, lest you go overboard with the next wave. I trust my men to get us out of the storm. Make yourself useful, and catch the fish thrown on deck by waves.
SPCX690*#*Men have enough of fish. But the cook does not have any other ingredients in the kitchen. Get some vegetables to stop their whining. I don’t care what they are.
SPCX691*#*You can never have enough currency when you go to the Spice Islands. Fetch some precious stones. Jewels are always a good way to sweeten the deal with the spice merchants.
SPCX692*#*I heard there are pirates hunting in these waters. They are foolish if they think they can capture our ship. We will not go down easily. Bring more ammo for our cannons.
SPCX693*#*How have they gotten behind us unseen? Who? The pirates! Tell your men to get ready. We are going to drown these thieving dogs.
SPCX694*#*The pirates have captured half my crew. Now how am I going to sail on? I have no time for rescue missions. Give the pirates what they want, and pay the ransom for my men.
SPCX695*#*The ship is damaged quite badly after the clash with the pirates. I admit, it did not go as I planned. Nevertheless, we must continue. Repair what you can and let’s go.
SPCX696*#*We need to avoid pirates now. Let’s scare them away so they leave us alone. I played a bit with the pumpkins you brought. With candles inside they look pretty scary.
SPCX697*#*No ship has come near us anymore. But we could still improve our disguise. Together with the smell of dead fish we will surely scare away even the toughest pirates.
SPCX698*#*There are some rocks in the sea. Go and look if we can chip off a piece. The stone around here is used by local sculptors. You could get a nice bit of gold for it.
SPCX699*#*Exotic birds from the rocks followed you back to the ship? Must be the smell of dead fish. I know some people who might be interested in them. Put them into cages.
SPCX700*#*The shrieking of the birds adds well to our disguise of a haunted ship. I just saw a ship with a black flag steer away from us. We can safely carry more gold like this.
SPCX701*#*Rumors are starting among the crew that posing as a ghost ship will bring us bad luck. Take the fools to nearby port and recruit tougher men. I don't need these cowards.
SPCX702*#*We are nearing the Cape of Good Hope. This area is known for stormy weather. We should strengthen the main mast while we can. It got chipped in the last storm
SPCX703*#*Our birds are getting skinny. Are you feeding them well? Must I remind you of their importance to us? Feed them and scrub their droppings from the deck. It’s disgusting.
SPCX704*#*Using the pumpkins has a small downside. They rot quickly. We will need new ones. This brown muck that is left of the old pumpkins is good only for the fish.
SPCX705*#*You see the dark clouds before us? That will be a furious storm. Bring more ballast for our ship. It will help her sail steady even in the wild waves which will come.
SPCX706*#*In the cargo hold are some planks you can use to cover it. However, you will have to get your own nails to fix them in place. Hurry, before we are filled with water!
SPCX707*#*The waves are high as a tower. Men are afraid we will sink. I promised them more gold if we get through. I'll round this cape even if I should sail here for all eternity!
SPCX708*#*Some men have gone overboard! They are still on the surface. Try to find all of them, and save as many as you can! The ship won’t sail itself if the crew drowns.
SPCX709*#*I am not going to wait out this storm in a safe port! Even should I be eternally damned! Give the men some buckets so they can get the water away from the deck.
SPCX710*#*The sun should be still above our heads but the heavy clouds keep all light away. We can use the pumpkins to shed some light around. And let’s sail onward!
SPCX711*#*You seem familiar, sailor. Have we met before? Ah! You’re the captain that helped me before… the accident. For your service, perhaps I will not pull you into the deep.
SPCX712*#*You wonder what happened to my handsome visage? Just a minor mishap. Don’t let it bother you. Now if you bring me some sharp blades, we might continue our business.
SPCX713*#*Take the ballast from the ship. We do not need it anymore. And add yours too to build an unexpected reef near the shore. Why you ask? To catch some unsuspecting prey.
SPCX714*#*Men have always been lured in by gold. Just a glint of it and they would gladly sell their soul. I know you are no different. Don’t worry, you will get what you deserve.
SPCX715*#*As you can see, my ship is a bit worse for wear than before. No point in fixing her now. Just nail some planks here and there and the wind will carry us on.
SPCX716*#*Now I will show you what I must do now to keep the Devil appeased. First, you must lure some ship near and let the sailors see us. Leave the rest to me.
SPCX717*#*You remember the reef you helped me build? It’s yielding fruit already. Just go look for yourself what became of the poor sailors and bring me the thing you find.
SPCX718*#*Not needing to eat is quite dangerous. You might even forget your humanity. Bring me some fish and let’s pretend we are hungry...for food.
SPCX719*#*Some of my crew tried to flee in a boat. There is no escape once you are a ghost. To make them understand that put shackles on them. They will sail with me forever.
SPCX720*#*Fearful sailors use it to anchor when they see a storm coming. We’ll build scary figures on the rocks nearby. To make them think twice about going into port.
SPCX721*#*There are many legends about treasures in sunken shipwrecks. Let’s indulge the seekers and make them true. The heavy gold will also make it hard to reach the surface again.
SPCX722*#*It would be boring to let the gold just lay around. It needs to be secured in a heavy chest which is hard to open and hard to carry. We are not giving it away so easily.
SPCX723*#*You are curious about what happened to me, right? I don’t remember much. I just know that I will never reach my goal now. And neither will the sailors who cross my path.
SPCX724*#*No soul lost at sea will go to waste. They will serve to warn others away from this godforsaken waters and as a fuel on my eternal voyage across the seas.
SPCX725*#*Sometimes I wish I could step on land again. But our anchor got ripped off and lost. Find me a new one and let’s try to go to port. I might even break this curse.
SPCX726*#*I was foolish to try. We couldn't even get near the coast and the strong current took us away. We might have to build our bay. Make a small island of rocks in the shallows.
SPCX727*#*Even the fish laugh at my futile tries. It seems I can’t break this curse so easily. You can’t cheat the devil just like that. So on we sail! The stormy sea awaits us.
SPCX728*#*Go into a port and ask people about any ghost ships they saw. I am curious what is said about us. You can also buy some supplies. Your crew still needs them.
SPCX729*#*I see, not many know about my ghost ship yet. Lead some sailors from the town here. They will spread the tales. Choose the brave ones, we have no use for cowards.
SPCX730*#*We will send letters to the ships we encounter. After reading them the fate of the unsuspecting sailors will be sealed. Prepare a small boat on which we will send them.
SPCX731*#*Ah! They opened the letters, curious little humans. And now they will never see land again. Come, bring them to me so they can join us on our endless voyage.
SPCX732*#*My men fished up some pretty white bones from the sea. I have a mind to use them as a decoration for our ship. They will add the right atmosphere. Nail them to the deck!
SPCX733*#*I've been thinking about ways to enhance the terror we spread. Rain of dead fish would be impressive. But I still need to work on it. Can’t quite get them up into the air.
SPCX734*#*Our cursed reef is starting to fall apart. The sea is not gentle to anyone, not even the rocks. With a few stones we can make it hold for a while longer.
SPCX735*#*Scaring sailors is fun but I miss the taste of food and solid ground under my feet. I heard about a witch who might know how to break this curse. But it won’t be for free.
SPCX736*#*What did the witch say? I should find my true love? She is a fraud that’s clear. Get some sailors talking. Somebody must have heard about a curse like this before.
SPCX737*#*We must get back to work. The sailors won’t find their way to damnation by themselves. Get another boat and send letters to the ship that is closing in on us.
SPCX738*#*You are starting to have second thoughts about helping me. You are still alive after all so there might be a way out. But don’t you want to save these poor lost souls?
SPCX739*#*I was lying. There is no saving them. But at least they don’t suffer the cruel sea and harsh weather. Maybe. You could lock them inside an iron cask so they are safe.
SPCX740*#*Go look for a golden fish which will fulfil my three wishes. Then we will both be free of this undead predicament. I promise I will let you have a wish too.
SPCX741*#*And you are still here? I thought you had prefered a watery grave to working with a sea demon like myself. Well, since you are here help me build a dock.
SPCX742*#*As you can see, I’m still not giving up on getting rid of this curse. My current plan is to build a floating dock where I could anchor my ship. So the stone is useless.
SPCX743*#*Go to the town and buy some proper tools. We can’t build anything with just our hands. But don’t dawdle there long. I have all eternity but you might die at any moment.
SPCX744*#*Who is this woman you bring with you? She said she was curious about the lonely ghost captain? Phe! I am not lonely. Let’s see how she will cope among my ghostly crew.
SPCX745*#*She is sticking her nose into things that don’t concern her. Why did I allow her on board? She wants to help the lost souls. Just let her see them so she is satisfied.
SPCX746*#*The wench is making my crew nervous. Asking questions, looking all over the place and so on. She should make herself useful. Give her needlework or something.
SPCX747*#*Now she needs food. I should let her starve and be done with it. Give her some of your supplies or just catch a few fish. I hope she will like them raw.
SPCX748*#*We talked about my curse. She said she might know how to break it. But wouldn’t say how. All humans want gold, right? Bring lots of it, then she will tell for sure.
SPCX749*#*I wish she would just tell me what’s wrong. We can talk about the curse later. Maybe she can’t sleep well on the hammock in her cabin. Make her a proper bed.
SPCX750*#*Why would she do that? She just looked at me and jumped over the railing. Something is different. I feel so tired all of a sudden. And hungry. Is this skin on my face?
SPCX751*#*The master watchmaker will be here soon. My name is John Fitch, an apprentice here. You need your watch repaired? Take a seat and eat something while you wait.
SPCX752*#*I will let you in on something. I am just an apprentice now but I am planning to open my own business soon. But first I am looking for an investor. Would you be interested?
SPCX753*#*I know my way around machines and metals. Learned much of it by myself. My family had no money to send me to study, but I am a quick learner. Let me show you something.
SPCX754*#*A beautiful watch casing, right? I made it from a bit of metal. It’s empty inside now so it does not work, but with a few mechanical parts you could use it as a pocket watch.
SPCX755*#*I plan to open a foundry. I want to start with something simple and make a name for myself. There is an old blacksmith workshop that could be rebuilt to serve my purpose.
SPCX756*#*I have already quit my apprenticeship at the watchmaker. I just need some tools and we can open the foundry. I have to earn money for wedding. My fiancée is getting nervous.
SPCX757*#*I am sorry I did not invite you to the wedding. It was just a small event. Now go to the port and try to get some customers for our foundry. The shop is empty all the time.
SPCX758*#*I have been watching this newest invention from Europe, the steam engine. I have a feeling I could make a fortune out of it. I need to buy more books on this.
SPCX759*#*The foundry is not as profitable as I hoped. And now that the war has begun hard times are coming. If I don’t want to get recruited as a soldier, I'll have to start making guns.
SPCX760*#*I have not mentioned it before, but I left my wife. With the money problems things got really tense. Come for a dinner tonight. I can’t help but feel lonely sometimes.
SPCX761*#*You can never know when some soldiers barge into your shop. Hopefully they will be on your side when it happens. I will feel more safe if we cover the windows with planks.
SPCX762*#*The war is ending and I have been offered to work as a land surveyor in the West. There is nothing keeping me here anymore. Let’s sell the workshop and tools and move on.
SPCX763*#*I have had enough of wandering the Northwestern territory. After being abducted by the Indians I want to live in some civilized land again. A small house would be sufficient.
SPCX764*#*During the years when I have been working as a surveyor I have bought land which should earn me money. Now I have the time to concentrate on my big project - the steamboat!
SPCX765*#*I tried to order a steam engine from England unfortunately without success. I will have to build my own. Come, I will give you a list of the items I need.
SPCX766*#*Whatever I do I can’t get it right. I have to ask for help. I know Mr. Henry Voigt, a skilled inventor and clockmaker, from my time as an apprentice. Let’s invite him for dinner.
SPCX767*#*It was well that I asked Mr. Voigt for help. He gave me some good advice and promised to help me with the engine. Bring me some material so we can get to work right away.
SPCX768*#*I was too eager to get it done. First we need to acquire the right tools for my workshop only then can we begin the construction. No wonder I have failed before.
SPCX769*#*If we are to use the steam engine on a boat, we will need a lot of information about ships and their construction. The sailors in the port will surely tell you all about it.
SPCX770*#*This project of mine will cost more than I expected. I am going to ask the state for funding. A steamboat transport is something that deserves their financial support.
SPCX771*#*I have been given a monopoly on steamboat transport. That will be helpful but I need to ask for funding from private people now. I already have an idea where to start.
SPCX772*#*We need to rework the engine again. I am sure you heard the explosion. Don’t worry, no one was hurt. We just have to begin anew. This time it will be a success for sure.
SPCX773*#*Now let’s get to the boat building itself. I have here plans and sketches which show how it should look. Bring some planks and we can get to work.
SPCX774*#*There still remains the question of how we make the boat move. I have thought about propelling it by a row of paddles fastened on a metal construction. Let’s try that.
SPCX775*#*We are ready for the trial run. Many people including potential investors will come to the Delaware River to watch our invention. So let’s prepare some refreshments.
SPCX776*#*However, the ship was too slow. The paddles need to be replaced by a better mechanism. We will ponder about it and you go ask the people how they liked our steamboat.
SPCX777*#*Henry is living in an inn and it's starting to be expensive. It will take time until we finish our work. How about you build a new room in my house where he can live?
SPCX778*#*The newest model will be more expensive but I promise this is the masterpiece everyone has waited for. I will need just a few more parts to finish it.
SPCX779*#*I want people talking about our boat before we launch it. There must be a crowd on the river banks. And I know how to do it, we need an advertisement in the local newspapers.
SPCX780*#*This time we will use a paddle wheel to propel the boat. I am sure we are on the right track now. The wheel will drive the boat faster and more smoothly than before.
SPCX781*#*I had a talk with Henry and we agreed. Our second steamboat is ready to be launched. Let’s not forget an anchor and we can present our newest model to the public.
SPCX782*#*I have received an offer of financial support for a third boat based on the latest model. It will be used to transport passengers. We will celebrate tonight!
SPCX783*#*If we want to build a passenger boat, it will have to be larger and for that we need more workers. I have received enough money to pay them, you just need to recruit them.
SPCX784*#*This building is too small for the new boat. Let’s remove that wall over there and build a larger workshop from our current one. I don’t feel like moving somewhere else.
SPCX785*#*You should already know all the parts we need to build the steam engine. Don’t hesitate to spend a bit more on them, our final boat has to be a masterpiece.
SPCX786*#*I almost forgot, I need to patent my steamboat before someone copies my work and reaps all the glory. You know how bureaucracy is, we will need some money to get the patent.
SPCX787*#*Should this be a passenger boat, we need to mind the design and comfort not just the technical details. We will add two rows of benches on each side of the boat.
SPCX788*#*This is the realization of my dream. I can’t wait to see her puffing up smoke and getting further along the river. Just the chimney is missing now and then we can launch her.
SPCX789*#*Tomorrow goes our steamboat on her maiden voyage. The first passengers should receive food and drinks for free to fully enjoy this special occasion.
SPCX790*#*The first passenger steamboat on the Delaware River is in service now. I do not doubt that this is the start of a new age in the ship transport. Wasn’t it wonderful to witness it?
SPCX791*#*Do you need a ferry across the river? Or are you just enjoying the impressive London scenery? The view is wonderful from the other side too. For a small fee I will take you across.
SPCX792*#*My name is John. I know, it’s just the most common name there is. At least you won’t forget it. Especially after what I am planning. Don’t panic, I am not going to drown you.
SPCX793*#*I am planning an unusual trip, from London to the sea on a paper boat. In the middle of winter, it’s crazy, you think? Maybe, but I won’t become famous by being normal.
SPCX794*#*Here we are, safely on the south bank. You are welcome to come watch me as I set off from London harbor. If you can, bring some fish. They are an important part in the scheme.
SPCX795*#*You wonder why I asked for the fish. Attached to sticks, they will serve as paddles. I got this idea when the neighbor’s boy threw a rock at me. My head still hurts.
SPCX796*#*There is one more favor I would like to ask of you. The paper boat is perfectly safe, but, just in case, could you ask some sailors to be nearby when I sail down the river?
SPCX797*#*You might have heard, that we are at civil war right now. In the cities it’s quite safe, but the mood is low. I hope to distract people with something pleasant in these dark times.
SPCX798*#*Did you see? I made it, the whole trip from London to the Isle of Sheppey! This is how Columbus must have felt! Now let’s start some fire. I am completely drenched.
SPCX799*#*I must have caught a cold on my big adventure. It was still totally worth it. Now I have the base for an exciting story. Just please repair my stove. I can feel the pneumonia closing in.
SPCX800*#*All we need to do, is bring it to the publisher. There is just one problem. I had a little argument with my agent, but a few coins should make him amenable right away.
SPCX801*#*You must be eager to read the book. I have a signed copy for you. I will give it to you at dinner tonight. You cook. I am an adventurous ferryman and poet, not a cook.
SPCX802*#*The paper boat trip was a total success. I should thank the neighbor’s kid for helping me perfect the idea. Do you know what would make him happy?
SPCX803*#*I would have given him a big rock. He seemed quite fond of them. But, you are right, that might have been dangerous. Nevermind, I have a use for the stones too.
SPCX804*#*Christmas will be here soon, and that always makes me feel generous. Call the sailors, who watched over my safe passage, for a drink. There is a cheap inn at the riverside.
SPCX805*#*I did not realize how much a sailor can drink. I doubt my pocket does hold the money to cover it all. You wouldn’t let me clean the dishes here to pay for it, right?
SPCX806*#*A poet cleaning dishes, that would have been a scandal! Now, let’s just repair the chairs and tables the rowdy sailors destroyed. I am never showing my face in this inn again.
SPCX807*#*Now, that I am without coin, I am prepared for my next adventure, the penniless pilgrimage. But this time, let’s take a proper boat. I bought one already, just the anchor is missing.
SPCX808*#*As I will be completely without money, I am ready to beg, work, or do other unseemly things to stay alive. But a solid supply of food for the start will be necessary.
SPCX809*#*When I am gone, try to repair the roof on my apartment. There is a small lake in my living room each time it rains. And here in London that is quite often.
SPCX810*#*I have had another great idea! I will pretend to be Father Christmas, bringing toys to children in my boat. People will welcome me to their homes, and offer me some food.
SPCX811*#*There is no place for the toys on my boat. I will have to manage without the disguise. But I still need proper paddles. Rowing up the river with fish would not get me far.
SPCX812*#*The boat sunk before I left the port. Something must be wrong. Call for some sailors to help me refloat it and fix it. I can’t afford a new one. Quick, before the water freezes over!
SPCX813*#*This journey might be cursed by bad luck. I love snow like any other Christmas enthusiast, but, in a boat without roof, it’s bad. Go buy some sheet I could use overhead.
SPCX814*#*The war is over, the king captive. I wonder what will be next, but at least it’s safe to travel the country now. So off we go to Scotland! And when I arrive, ready a pot with hot broth!
SPCX815*#*You caught up with me. I have been staying with this nice family for a while, they enjoy my poetry. Their pig shed could use a new roof. I am sure you can spare a moment.
SPCX816*#*Time to return to London, and work on a new book. Pack us some salted fish for the way back, and let’s go. I have already the first few verses in my head.
SPCX817*#*I must complete my next book before Christmas. It will be a perfect gift under the Christmas tree for every poetry lover. I will give it to all my friends, and some toys to their kids.
SPCX818*#*My publisher requires 50 more pages for the new book. Yet my adventurous experiences have been already exhausted. But there is a place where the inspiration comes to me easily.
SPCX819*#*As I have been soaking up inspiration from the common man’s everyday life, I became ensnared in a game of cards. Unfortunately my luck has been a bit shy of late.
SPCX820*#*The king has been executed. He might not have been the best ruler, but that was a bit cruel. I prefer to avoid politics, however, I can’t help but feel that something sinister is coming.
SPCX821*#*Christmas has been banned! I knew the change in government would be bad. Pen is mightier than the sword, so bring me the mightiest pen you can find. I will do what I can best, write.
SPCX822*#*I have been already planning a Christmas party, bought so many gifts, and released a new book ready for the Christmas sales. And now this! Let me bury my sorrow in food.
SPCX823*#*The puritans came to power now, and they say Christmas is not in the Bible. To make it all worse, the roof on my apartment is leaking again. This will be a cold unpleasant winter.
SPCX824*#*To show my disapproval, I will wear this red cape now, it’s also pleasantly warm. And let’s buy as many presents as we can and give them to strangers. I don’t care if I get arrested.
SPCX825*#*Distracted by my outrage, I forgot I wanted to write a poem to protest this nonsense. But first, let’s go ask the good men and women of our city for their honest opinions.
SPCX826*#*I will have to substitute a few harsh words used by the lads in harbor, but otherwise they were quite inspiring. Before I start, add a few logs to the hearth, the cold is creeping in.
SPCX827*#*Short but apt. Take it to the local newspaper to publish it in the next issue. You will need some money to persuade them. They will probably get a fine for publishing it.
SPCX828*#*With my poem I hope to wake a large public upheaval for the reinstalling of Christmas. Until people rise up, we can shovel the snow from my front door.
SPCX829*#*They say it serves only to excessively indulge in alcohol, unhealthy food and gambling. And that we should celebrate by fasting and restraint. Not me!
SPCX830*#*I went to the Riverside Inn yesterday, but guess what? The police closed it! Just like many others in the city. Are we supposed to just work all day, then play with toys at home?
SPCX831*#*When peaceful protests are not successful, you have to get inspiration from a little kid. Bring only the small rocks, we don't want to hurt anyone. Just make a little mess.
SPCX832*#*You might have to pay a small fine to get me out of jail. A grown man can’t get away with things that a child can. Unfortunately. Now, bring the money, it’s freezing here.
SPCX833*#*When you are locked in a cell, you have a lot of time to think. So listen up! First we will need passage on a ship. I have no money, so we will help unload cargo in the port.
SPCX834*#*I convinced the captain to take us North. Just go find the sailors, we are ready to go. I am now considered to be a subversive element, so it will be good to be away for a while.
SPCX835*#*To pass the time until we arrive, I started writing a new story about Father Christmas who visits our country and despairs. I need only food, otherwise I don't wish to be disturbed.
SPCX836*#*We are sailing to Norway. They have the most beautiful pine trees, especially grown to become Christmas trees. Prepare the saws, and make sure they are sharp.
SPCX837*#*Don’t worry, the pines grow here really fast, the cold and damp weather is perfect for them. Even if we cut off a few, the forest will be dense in no time again.
SPCX838*#*I have found this abandoned forester’s cottage near the pine forest. We can stay here while we get all the trees we need. Just build a fireplace inside, or we will freeze.
SPCX839*#*There must be at least two meters of snow here. There is never so much snow in London. It's quite trying to get through it. We will need a sturdy sled to get the trees to the ship.
SPCX840*#*There is a village nearby. Go ask some good farmer to lend us a reindeer to pull the sled. They have here reindeer instead of horses, right? Give him a few coins for the trouble.
SPCX841*#*Call the sailors to help us load the trees on the ship. I bet they are just sitting in the ship and shivering, hoping we will leave soon. A bit of work will warm them up.
SPCX842*#*I have heard there are the most excellent salmon in the Norwegian fjords. Get your fishing gear out, and let’s catch some. Just don’t fall into the water, it’s freezing cold.
SPCX843*#*That’s a lot of salmon, and there are other fish too. Let’s smoke them to make them last the voyage back to England. Spread them on the iron racks, and I will start fire.
SPCX844*#*The wind is carrying away all the smoke. Pile up some rocks to create walls, and trap it here. It will also prevent a wildfire. It would be sad if the beautiful forest burned to ash.
SPCX845*#*Now I smell like a smoked sausage. But I love a good sausage, so no harm done. Unlike me, our fish are not yet smoky enough, and the fire is burning out. We need more firewood.
SPCX846*#*We still have enough free space in the cargo hold of our ship. Go to the forest, and get some more pine trees. Just don’t sink into deep snow, or we will never find you again.
SPCX847*#*What I would do for a steaming hot tea with rum or a mulled wine. Let’s go visit the local inn, maybe someone there will play cards. You know that Norway is quite expensive, right?
SPCX848*#*Call our shipmates to have a drink with us, too. We still have some money left for them to drink a bit, but not so much, that they won’t be able to take us home.
SPCX849*#*We have all we need now. Time we returned home. I hope the seeds of Christmas rebellion we sought have already taken roots. Now we bring our trees to make them even stronger.
SPCX850*#*The North Sea is restless today. I wanted a respite from the ice cold shower, but was almost crushed by a tree, when I went below deck. Use the chains to keep the trees in place.
SPCX851*#*London looks just like when we left, bleak and dark. When we place the trees on the streets, everything will get merrier, you’ll see. Now we just need carts to transport them.
SPCX852*#*We will mark the spots, where the trees should be placed, with these rocks. Here is a map, take care of the southern part of the city. But be careful that the policemen don’t spot you.
SPCX853*#*Nobody saw you? Good. Now bring the Christmas trees from the ship. I hope you decorated them well. With apples, nuts and cookies. Candles will be a nice touch, too.
SPCX854*#*Let’s find out what happened while we were gone. I have some informants in the city, who supply me with the juiciest news for my stories. They will want some coins for the information.
SPCX855*#*We may have a chance to get our Christmas back. Call people from the port to make a Christmas protest in the city. And give them some red capes as the symbol of our cause.
SPCX856*#*I have learned that rocks are no way to get what we want. But fish might be more persuasive. Let’s use the old, smelly ones. The fishermen on the pier will happily supply us.
SPCX857*#*We were lucky not to end up in a cell. And now I can concentrate on making these wonderful iron ornaments for Christmas trees. Come, help me, it’s really easy.
SPCX858*#*I will be having a Christmas party. Just a small event with the tree, lot’s of food, and some gifts. But we will have to keep it quiet. Help me clean up the living room.
SPCX859*#*You must not tell anyone about it. Or we would all end up celebrating Christmas in prison. I will send out coded invitations etched on these little rocks. Clever, right?
SPCX860*#*Take some guys with you, and place the rocks at my friends’ front doors. Just don’t let anyone throw them through windows. That would make an unwelcome turmoil.
SPCX861*#*Do you love the fresh smell of pine needles like me? I just can’t get enough of it. Let’s share this joy and give out the trees to people in my neighborhood. Plant them in their gardens.
SPCX862*#*Do you know that in the central Europe fish is the traditional Christmas meal? It is usually a baked carp. Well, I don’t mind trying something new on this special day.
SPCX863*#*But we can’t eat only fish. There is a great bakery around the corner. Buy the Christmas pudding, yule log and gingerbread. I want them all freshly baked, straight from the oven.
SPCX864*#*There are soldiers on the streets. Something is happening. Come with me, we are going to find out what’s going on. Just pretend like you are delivering something to avoid suspicion.
SPCX865*#*They go to the parliament. This will be an eventful night before Christmas. I am afraid this could end up with violence. I am a peaceful man, so we better go home and bar the doors.
SPCX866*#*The neighbor was just here with the latest news. We have a change in government again. A new king is on the throne. I hope this means a return of the old ways for us.
SPCX867*#*Together with abolishing all laws established during the puritan government, the new king lifted the ban on Christmas. We are free to celebrate excessively again.
SPCX868*#*I don't know if our effort made a difference, but the important thing is, we don’t have to hide or protest anymore. Come, and call all your friends and family to celebrate a merry Christmas.
SPCX869*#*This holiday is all about giving and kindness, so let’s offer some food to the less fortunate. There are plenty fish in the sea, which can feed many families.
SPCX870*#*I have never forsaken hope that we will get our Christmas back. I did not sell as many books as I wanted to, but this is still the best Christmas I could wish for.
SPCX871*#*I did not see you. The port is full of people at this time of the day. I am looking for a ship to take us to America. Me and my wife don’t require much, just a small cabin with a bed.
SPCX872*#*I am Charles, a writer, and this is my wife Catherine. You look like a well-read person. Have you perhaps read some of my works? If not, I am sure the bookstore will have a book or two by me.
SPCX873*#*I was invited to give a few lectures in New York. I plan to do a bit of sightseeing, too. The vast prairies in the West seem especially intriguing. But I heard, it can be dangerous there.
SPCX874*#*I will be staying with a friend and his family in New York. I carry a few of my signed books for him and his wife, but their children would probably enjoy something different.
SPCX875*#*I see you are an experienced captain. The voyage could not be smoother. Usually, I have a seasickness while sailing. But on your ship, I feel fine. I can eat whatever I want without fear.
SPCX876*#*I hope you will take us back to England in a few months. In the meantime, you can make use of the profitable sea trade here. If you hire a few more workers, you can earn a small fortune.
SPCX877*#*Just a small suggestion before we part. There are still many people coming to America and building their new homes here. If you import stone and bricks, you will surely not lose on it.
SPCX878*#*Good to see you again. I hope you had a good time here, just like me. I have a lot of memories and an idea for a new book. Will you add a table and a chair to our cabin, so I can start writing?
SPCX879*#*I apologise for disturbing you, when you are at the helm, captain. But my wife Catherine feels that it’s very cold in our cabin. Do you have some heater we could use?
SPCX880*#*You are heading for the port in Manchester? No problem, from there we can go home by train. I am not sure if we have enough money for the ticket. But don’t worry, we will think of something.
SPCX881*#*You did not have to return part of the fee we paid for the voyage to England. I wish there were more people as generous and kind as you. Let me at least invite you for lunch.
SPCX882*#*There are so many destitute people here. The conditions they live in are terrible. If you can, please send your sailors to the city and try to help the poor people. We should help each other.
SPCX883*#*While I am here, I will make an inspection of the local factory. I heard they make children work there. That is horrible! Let’s take something for them, to make them feel better.
SPCX884*#*I took the children who looked sick with me to the hospital. They will take care of them there. But the head nurse mentioned they don’t have enough beds for all of them.
SPCX885*#*If you have some time, help the workers with the tiles for the new roof on the hospital. I have to go home now, and write a story that will open people's eyes. You are always welcome to visit me.
SPCX886*#*It’s good of you to come visit me. You can help me with my new story. It’s about Christmas. I am sorry, but you will have to pay for a room at the inn, I don’t have a free bed at home.
SPCX887*#*We begin our story on a cold Christmas evening in London, where we meet the greedy hero, Mr. Scrooge. Wait! I think Catherine is calling. The dinner is ready. We will continue afterwards.
SPCX888*#*Mr. Scrooge will be visited by a ghost. You don’t believe in ghosts? It will surely catch readers’ attention. Oh no! The wind has broken the shutters on the window. Bring nails so we can repair them.
SPCX889*#*I write a Christmas story, and yet I totally neglected the decoration of our home. Catherine takes care of cooking and baking, but the tree is my responsibility. Help me find the right one.
SPCX890*#*The ghost will warn our anti-hero of the fate that’s awaiting him if he doesn’t change his ways. Take the first chapter and read it to your crew, then tell me how they liked it.
SPCX891*#*Now comes a spirit, who will take Scrooge to his past. This will be an idyllic Christmas time, before he became a greedy old man. Anyway, my neighbour is rebuilding his porch. Can you get some flagstones for him?
SPCX892*#*I heard of a new invention to make writing easier, a typewriter. I would love to try it, my hand hurts from writing all the time. There are only a few prototypes, so it will be expensive.
SPCX893*#*You acquired it! The typewriter is bigger than I expected, and won’t fit on my writing table. I will have to get a new table and place it in the living room.
SPCX894*#*In the third part we will visit more scenes. First we will go to a Christmas market. Let’s go to the town, and get some inspiration from a real market. We can also buy some food for tomorrow.
SPCX895*#*I also want to write a scene in a lighthouse. There is one on the cliffs beyond the town. Let’s take some oil lamps for the lighthouse keeper, so he will be more willing to take us on a tour.
SPCX896*#*Now, that Christmas is getting closer, the demand for pine trees is getting higher. The lighthouse keeper wanted one, too. While I finish the third chapter, deliver some trees from the forest up north.
SPCX897*#*A big part of my stories focuses on children. I can’t leave them out of this story either. Ask your crew about their children, maybe there is a great story hidden, which I could use.
SPCX898*#*In the next chapter we will look into the future, to Scrooge’s funeral. That reminds me, Grandpa’s grave is in need of a new headstone. It will be a kind of Christmas gift for poor Gramps.
SPCX899*#*This will be a very sad part of the story, but it will serve to change the mind of our main character. Still, I feel a bit glum after writing it. I could use a little break, let’s go buy Christmas gifts.
SPCX900*#*Our family has a tradition. On the Christmas eve we start a fire in the fireplace. The warm light creates the true Christmas atmosphere. But first, we need a few logs for the fire.
SPCX901*#*I am going to lock myself up in the room, and finish the book. Meanwhile, you can help Catherine in the kitchen. I am sure she has some work for you. I think she needs a few new baking pans.
SPCX902*#*She has send you for fish? Catherine knows I dislike them. But they are healthy, I know, especially for our kids. If they are baked with bacon and herbs, I will manage.
SPCX903*#*Did you put our tree into water? No? That’s why the needles are already all over the floor. I still have some money, please, go buy a new one, and place it in a bowl of water.
SPCX904*#*We are nearing the end of my story. A good Christmas story needs a happy ending to leave a pleasant feeling in the readers. How about you indulge your sailors, and take them for an eggnog?
SPCX905*#*I think you already guessed it. Scrooge is going to redeem himself and share his gold with his family and friends to prevent the unpleasant future. He will still die someday, but people will care.
SPCX906*#*I hope none who reads my story will be able to retain his heart of stone like Scrooge. With the theme of Christmas, the book will surely have the impact I wished for.
SPCX907*#*Of course, I still need to review it, change some passages, and correct some misspellings. Then we just cut the wood for the fire and enjoy this lovely winter evening.
SPCX908*#*A catching title might be even more important than the story itself. How else will you pick the interest of your readers, even before they open the book?
SPCX909*#*Just like our story we will finish this with a pleasant Christmas dinner. But, please, don’t bring fish anymore. I have had enough of them for a lifetime.
SPCX910*#*Should you have a few free moments during this Christmas season, read my book. I assure you it’s a classic, and will stay popular even in a 100 years and longer.
SPCX911*#*Pardon the intrusion, captain. I am looking for a partner to supply our expedition to New France. We will need a lot of materials, especially during the long winter.
SPCX912*#*I am Samuel de Champlain, a royal geographer. I have been entrusted with the exploration of our new colony across the ocean. Come, I will tell you the details over dinner.
SPCX913*#*I will be a passenger on the ship of François Du Pont. He is an experienced captain, and has already been to New France before. We are sailing off tomorrow, so tell your sailors to be ready.
SPCX914*#*The main goal of this voyage is fur trading. My official status is just an observer, but I will be looking for a suitable place for a permanent settlement, and establishing relations with the natives.
SPCX915*#*François is a good man. You will get to like him too, I am sure. How about we spend the evening together, and talk about your sea adventures, while drinking some fine French wine?
SPCX916*#*I looked up all I could about the previous expeditions, and why they failed. We must befriend the natives, not alienate them. However, some weapons to ensure our safety will be necessary.
SPCX917*#*We have two Indians on board, who came with the last expedition. They learned our language, and can translate for us. They love bouillabaisse. If you want to win them over, bring some.
SPCX918*#*This is Tadoussac, a port where we trade with the Indians. We will set up a camp on the shore. François was here before, he will know where to find materials we need.
SPCX919*#*I forgot to bring my astrolabe. We might get lost easily without it. There is an English expedition camping to the south. Ask them if they have a spare one they could sell to us.
SPCX920*#*I have noticed there are Indians gathering on the other side of the river. If you are done with setting up the camp, bring a barque, and let’s go across. We can’t pass up this chance.
SPCX921*#*Give your sailors some work to do before we leave. We don’t want them marching around, and appear threatening. They can go gather firewood, or look for some food.
SPCX922*#*Here we go. Smile, and don’t look them in the eyes. Our two translators are with us, so leave the talking to them for now. Have you brought something as a gift?
SPCX923*#*They like our wine, but it seems to affect them quite strongly. Maybe we should give it out sparsely. Go look what they have in the kettles. It smells wonderful.
SPCX924*#*I never had moose stew before. It tastes almost like beef to me. There is also roasted meat of bear, seal and beaver. It’s definitely exotic, but I think I still prefer a grilled fish.
SPCX925*#*The tribes gathered to celebrate the victory over their common enemy, the Iroquois. Let’s help them build more lasting totems as a sign of their success. They are not very good stone masons.
SPCX926*#*The chieftain believes, we can help them fight against Iroquois, once they attack again. This is a perfect chance to form an alliance. Now we can get to business, so let’s buy some furs.
SPCX927*#*It’s time to return to our camp. Tomorrow we set off to explore the land along the local rivers, so get a good night’s sleep. I hope the barques are ready for the exploration.
SPCX928*#*Wake up the sailors, who will join us on the expedition. A part of them has to stay here, they can hunt for seals and wild animals. We need to bring a lot of furs back to France.
SPCX929*#*We should take our weapons with us, in case we meet the Iroquois. We are friends of their enemies, so expect an attack should we meet them. And don’t forget my favorite arquebus.
SPCX930*#*The winter is not even here, yet the weather is freezing cold. A delicate French wine would make me warm, and remind me of my beloved homeland. Do we have some bottles left?
SPCX931*#*We have gone quite far on the Saguenay River, yet the land around does not look promising. But I have seen beautiful white beluga whales under the water. Let’s try to feed them some fish.
SPCX932*#*Feeding the whales was an experience I will remember for long. The sun is setting down, we should make camp for the night. Find some rocks to form a circle around our fire.
SPCX933*#*Tomorrow we turn back and explore the St. Lawrence River instead. I hope the land will be more pleasant there. Here are only rocky mountains and forests. At least we have enough wood for the fire.
SPCX934*#*We are passing Tadoussac again. There are still some natives camping here. Let’s buy a few supplies from them for the voyage before us. I would not mind a bit of the moose stew, too.
SPCX935*#*The country looks the same here as it did around the Saguenay River. I am disappointed, this is no land for a settlement. I think I am in mood for another glass of wine.
SPCX936*#*I believe this is the island that was explored by my fellow French explorer some 60 years ago. The land is more level here. Let’s anchor at the narrowing of the river called Kebec by the Indians.
SPCX937*#*Let the sailors make camp, and we can look around. I like what I see here. If this soil were cultivated, it would be as good as ours in France. This might be the place we were looking for.
SPCX938*#*This land looks promising, but we should not get too far from our base camp. We can explore more on our way back. I can see there are a lot of colorful fish in the river. Maybe they taste good.
SPCX939*#*We have still some time. I heard from the chieftain that there are caves with precious stones under a steep hill, near the sea. I think it’s worth exploring.
SPCX940*#*Our time of exploration is coming to an end. The king expects my report soon, so we must return to France. After we make some necessary repairs, we can set the course for home.
SPCX941*#*Your help was indispensable. Now I must go give my report to the king. I have also written a book on the way back, read it when it comes out. I hope we meet again sometime.
SPCX942*#*Captain! So good to see you again. We meet when I need you the most. We are setting off to establish a new colony. Join our fleet, and take some materials aboard, we have a lot to transport.
SPCX943*#*While we cross the ocean, let me tell you about the hard times I have experienced. We have already built a few settlements, but all ended in failure. We are lucky the king approved this expedition.
SPCX944*#*The sites we have chosen before were the reason for our failure. This time I found the perfect place near the St. Lawrence River. It’s easily defensible and near the center of the fur trade.
SPCX945*#*We will need people with skills such as woodcutters, smiths, masons, carpenters and many more to make the colony prosper. I have also enlisted a gardener and a surgeon.
SPCX946*#*We are at our old base camp again. Little has changed here since you have been here the last time. We will anchor our ships here, take some of the material, and continue on small boats.
SPCX947*#*This is the place I chose for the new settlement. We were here before, remember? We will start with clearing up the place, cutting down trees, and making beams and planks from the wood.
SPCX948*#*Like before, we are financed by the fur trade. Hats from beaver pelts are the latest fashion in Paris. You buy the furs from Indians for a tenth of the price you get for them in France.
SPCX949*#*The men need a filling meal to keep up the good work. There are excellent cod fish in the river which will make for a hearty dinner. Catch some while I prepare the fire.
SPCX950*#*We need more material to continue the works. We have left a part of them at the harbor in Tadoussac. If you have some men, who are not needed here, send them for the supplies.
SPCX951*#*Winter will be here soon. The first building standing needs to be a storehouse, where we can keep the supplies. Our previous settlements had large difficulties with food during winter.
SPCX952*#*The storage is finished and we can place the most treasured thing from home in it - French wine, of course. A glass of wine will lift our spirit even in the hardest of times.
SPCX953*#*Now we can concentrate on the main structure. I made a design with three connected buildings, one for the workers, one for me, and the third will be a forge and a workshop.
SPCX954*#*The functionality is essential, but one convenient decoration on the main building won’t hurt. I want to place a great sundial on the front wall, as a symbol of light, time and order.
SPCX955*#*All the people here don’t work for free. I promised them a monthly pay, otherwise they would not be here. And they do a good work, so let’s pay them.
SPCX956*#*I learned something alarming. There is a conspiracy against me. A few men plan to kill me, and take over the settlement. We will prepare a trap for them. Come, I will explain the plan by dinner.
SPCX957*#*I hope everything is clear. Let’s go get these treacherous betrayers! Tell a few men you trust to be ready. The conspirators might resist detainment, we can’t let them escape.
SPCX958*#*There will be a trial for the conspirators. I detest unnecessary cruelty, but at least the main organizer will have to hang to deter anyone else from such plans. You should prepare the gallows.
SPCX959*#*We have established good relations with the natives, but not all tribes are friendly. Other colonists from Europe can be dangerous, too. So we will dig a moat and build a wall around the houses.
SPCX960*#*The soil here is rich and fertile. We should not have much difficulties with farming. We will need the seeds of grains, beans, some vegetables and fruit. And don’t forget the grape vine.
SPCX961*#*Our native friends have come asking for help in their fight against the Iroquois. We have to help them defend their people. I hope it will end in a lasting peace between the Indians.
SPCX962*#*The winter is coming. We should start gathering supplies. Our garden is ready for the first harvest, and our hunters are skilled. Still, it won’t hurt to buy some things, too.
SPCX963*#*The land is covered in snow, and it seems the Indians have bad luck hunting. There was a party to ask for some food earlier today. Look if we have some salted fish in the storage.
SPCX964*#*The snowstorm today is just getting more furious. The guards have spied the Indians trying to cross the river to seek shelter here. Get some of our barques out there, and help them across.
SPCX965*#*We don’t have enough food for our people and the Indians, too. They can’t stay here long, but we can give them shelter until the storm ends. Send the men to help the injured.
SPCX966*#*A sickness has broken out among the settlers. We need to keep the sick ones separated from the healthy. Make some space in the workshop, so we can move them there.
SPCX967*#*It seems that our doctor managed to get the sickness under control. The patients are feeling better. We should build a new stove in the workshop, the warmth will speed up their healing.
SPCX968*#*Now scurvy is ravaging my people. It’s the lack of fresh food. We have enough bread and beans, but that is not enough. We need some fruit or vegetables. Have you anything left?
SPCX969*#*The winter has taken it’s toll. But, finally, the spring is here and our colony has made it through these hard times. Now that the ice has broken up over the river, we can catch some tasty cod fish again.
SPCX970*#*There is still a lot of work before me to make this settlement prosper. But I know, you have also other engagements elsewhere. I thank you for your help. Good luck captain!
SPCX971*#*Going for some easy exploration? I ventured out for a little voyage too. Unfortunately, my ship hit the reef. My eyesight is not what it used to be. Do you have some planks for the repairs?
SPCX972*#*It’s always good to meet a fellow captain. We have been preparing dinner just now. You are welcome to join us, and bring some food, so we can share. We have meat and bread.
SPCX973*#*If ye want to keep yer life, ye will pay with gold. And no heroics! Or ye will get me sword stuck into yer gut.
SPCX974*#*Have we met before? Never mind, I have a problem. My shipment of fine cloth is endangered! A pirate stole the crates in which I planned to store the wares. I will pay you nicely if you sell me some.
SPCX975*#*I was once a captain just like you. But my old bones are happy to be on solid ground now. I have a lot of capable sailors under my wing. I can hire you some, to help you on your exploration.
SPCX976*#*Our ship has run aground, and now is sinking. I managed to get to the shore, but a large part of my crew is still in the water. If you have some boats, please, go, and save them.
SPCX977*#*I’m fine, just having some difficulties finding food on this forsaken island. There are no plants, no animals, just rocks, ash and lava. Even the sea here is barren, no fish as far as I can see.
SPCX978*#*Taking a break on your voyage? This island has the richest iron ore mines I have ever seen. It would be sad to just leave all the iron here. If you help me with the mining, I will share it with you.
SPCX979*#*We are a bit behind the schedule with the renovation of ballroom in my palace. Our supplier of marble has backed out on us in the last minute. I will send some sailors to help you with the stone.
SPCX980*#*This is the perfect oak for the rum barrels. If I only had a saw and an axe, I would have the barrels ready in no time. The newest batch of the liquor needs to be stored soon.
SPCX981*#*One would think that, when going south it would get warmer. Wrong! I am freezing. There are not even proper trees growing here, so I could build a fire. Just moss and grass all around.
SPCX982*#*This is a dangerous passage. The rocks are hiding under water, ready to wreck your ship anytime. I am building here a lighthouse, to warn the ships away from the reef. Care to help?
SPCX983*#*So you set out to explore? A sailor must sometimes venture into the unknown to prove his mettle. If you bring me some stone, I will give you some tips how to survive out here.
SPCX984*#*How about something sweet to get your energy for the journey ahead? For just a few coins I will sell you this wonderful cocoa. Still hesitating? I will add some useful information, too.
SPCX985*#*I am not going to attack you. Even we vikings can be friendly sometimes. Anyway, I am too busy building a settlement for my people on this island we discovered. Actually, I could use more bricks.
SPCX986*#*Our last raid did not go so good. If I return with empty hands, I will never hear the end of it from my wife. For some gold, I will give you useful information, and throw in a few fish for free.
SPCX987*#*Your sails look a bit damaged. The strong wind here can tear even the best of cloths. But not mine! I will give you a few rolls for new sails. With some needles we can make them in no time.
SPCX988*#*Say what you want, but the northern seas have the best fish. I have been out there fishing, but a playful whale nudged my boat. I need a new boat to bring some food home.
SPCX989*#*Let’s make a deal. Not that ye have a choice. A few of me pirates are tired of the dangerous trade, an’ wish to earn a living honestly. For a few treasure chests, I will release them to ye.
SPCX990*#*This is my home. I like to sit in my chair by the window and read about the adventures of other explorers. But lately wild wolves wander around our house. I probably need to built a fence.
SPCX991*#*Another unsuspectin’ sailor, I see. I’d have robbed ye like all the others, but I am mournin’. Me parrot died. He was a cheeky little bastard, but I miss him. Help me make him a proper grave.
SPCX992*#*I am so glad you came. Our ship was wrecked and sunk, thankfully all my sailors including me have managed to get to the beach. But now we are starving.
SPCX993*#*Will you help me build an army of stone? I create soldiers and horses, they will all stand still, unmovable as a rock, no matter what kind of enemy comes. I just need tools for the finer engravings.
SPCX994*#*Are you sure you want to explore these dangerous waters? Well, the reward will be surely worth it, but you will have to work for it. I can lend you a helping hand if you will hire me.
SPCX995*#*I am pleased to see you again. I am inspecting the new land Columbus has discovered. Will you help my men establish a settlement here? We need some wood for the houses.
SPCX996*#*Come, sit down with me, captain, and bring a bottle of wine. I am a bit sad. My crew left me here after a little discord with the natives. They probably think I am dead, and so sailed away without me.
SPCX997*#*I am overseeing the building of a new rum distillery here. Part of my men are mining the stone to build the whole structure. But we still need some metal for the distilling apparatus.
SPCX998*#*Ye don’t want to get hurt, right? Now place all the gold ye carry into these wooden boxes. I am sure ye are rich enough. But a poor pirate like me has to live from somethin’.
SPCX999*#*I am tired of sailing on this phantom ship. Build me a real wooden ship, and I will let you go. I may even release these sailors, who are trapped on my ghost ship.

SPHLP001*#*Game manual
SPHLP002*#*Welcome aboard, captain!
SPHLP003*#*Join us in our journey through the history of the greatest ships. This game manual will help you start with your business well prepared.
SPHLP004*#*Visions and aims
SPHLP005*#*The purpose of the game is to build up and gradually develop your port, where you produce all of the important commodities. Besides your port you need to focus on your fleet to be able to sail for more materials and simultaneously complete the tasks given to you by the game. Follow the hints of your future contractors to learn the basics.
SPHLP006*#*Basic materials are: fish, wood, stone and iron.
SPHLP007*#*It’s simple: the more XPs, the faster you level up. Hold your cursor over the level number and check how many XPs you need for another level.
SPHLP008*#*You can boost your XPs with any item purchase, item upgrade or by sailing to destinations.
SPHLP009*#*The main game currencies are: Gems, Coins, Sailors. Sailors have two values: sailor recovery (which is total profit) and total limit (the maximum of sailors you can have). You can boost your sailor values with the Town Hall building and with the House buildings.
SPHLP010*#*Coins are obtainable by sending ships to the Gold destinations on your map. After they return back to your port, the unloaded materials will be added to your stock. Furthermore, you can also be rewarded with coins from the friend's tasks, contracts and achievements.
SPHLP011*#*Gems are the most valuable material you can earn. Gems can be used to enhance your game experience and obtain exclusive items. You can obtain Gems by completing some achievements or contracts or you can purchase them which is a great way to support the game developers.
SPHLP012*#*Apart from the basic settings, there's also:<br/> <br/> <ul> <li>Antialiasing (for better visual experience) </li><li>Gem confirm (which warns you before any Gem spending)</li><li>Clouds (will toggle clouds on and off)</li><li>Fast Ships (which accelerates the process of sending ships)</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Your friends (where you can compare your level)</li><li>News (lets you know about new features and changes)</li><li>Save progress (to make sure that your actions won't get lost before closing the game)</li></ul>
SPHLP013*#*Add any active player to your Facebook profile and after you reload the game, this person should appear in your in-game ranking list. You can compare each other’s progress in the Friends tab.
SPHLP014*#*Map icon. We will explain the map's functionality in detail in the next steps.
SPHLP015*#*Expand your port by placing as many buildings as you can. Every building has a certain level requirement or the purchase depends on the upgrade level of the main building called Town Hall.
SPHLP016*#*Fish are produced by small fishing boats. You can increase their amount by updating the Fishing Pier building and by adding more fishing boats when the “plus” button is available.
SPHLP017*#*Fish are required for production of wood, stone and iron and also mechanical parts later in the game.
SPHLP018*#*Wood is produced in the Sawmill building (click the wood icon in the middle). A popup window will show you how much fish you need for the wood amount. Upgrade Sawmill to increase the wood production.
SPHLP019*#*Stone is produced in the Quarry building and iron in the Foundry. The whole production process works the same way as with wood.
SPHLP020*#*Mechanical parts will be needed later in the game for building steam ships.
SPHLP021*#*In the building called Tavern you can hire captains to boost your ship journeys.
SPHLP022*#*Town Hall is the most important building in the game. The whole development of your port depends on it as it unlocks new buildings and their upgrades. It also generates the sailor income and increases the sailor limit.
SPHLP023*#*Houses boost the sailor income and limit. Place them and upgrade them whenever you have enough resources.
SPHLP024*#*Main Dock enables you to start using ships at the beginning of the game. Main Dock upgrades will enable you to increase your maximum fleet size (which is the amount of ships you can use at once).
SPHLP025*#*Warehouse stores special commodities (e.g. cocoa, cloth) from contractors’ destinations or seasonal events. Seasonal event commodities won’t disappear from Warehouse until you trade them in Market Town. You can keep them in the Warehouse even after the seasonal event ends.
SPHLP026*#*Click on the green arrow to upgrade your building. You can also relocate your buildings.
SPHLP027*#*If you decide not to use a ship anymore, you can move it to the museum and you’ll get XPs in return. Also, Museum will give you a coin profit each hour – the more ships you have there, the better. Museum accepts only those ships that were upgraded at least to level 5. Also, only ships exceeding the Main Dock´s capacity can be placed to the Museum.
SPHLP028*#*Lighthouse improves your trading too and it’s available from level 15. It allows you to complete the so called Social Contracts (which are daily quests from your friends) and get some extra Coins or XPs as a reward. Rewards increase in proportion with your level. A random friend spawns on your map and gives you the quest. If you have less than 10 friends with Lighthouse there is a chance 50:50 that you’ll get a quest from a random Seaport player.
SPHLP029*#*You can upgrade Lighthouse after you reach level 40. Lighthouse upgrade will give you two social contracts per day.
SPHLP030*#*This sign means that some of your friends have completed a social contract from you. Since you are partially profiting from it, you can claim an XP reward.
SPHLP031*#*Ships are the coolest part of this game. They can cost either Gems or materials. The stars indicate how many upgrades you can make. If the stars are green, it means that these upgrades cost Gems only. If all stars are shining, you are purchasing an already fully upgraded ship. Ship purchases or upgrades give you XP’s too.
SPHLP032*#*A little lighthouse notifies you when your ships are arriving to your dock and how many of them are waiting for a place to dock. “Your ships” tab gives you an overview of your ship fleet.
SPHLP033*#*Every ship has a certain:<ul><li>Crew</li><li>Capacity</li></ul>The numbers in the brackets tell you the maximum you can reach when you fully upgrade the ship.<br/><br/>Every destination has a certain sail cost – it’s the number of sailors which will be deducted from your crew. A destination can only accept a ship which has a crew size high enough for the destination requirements. The destinations you cannot send your ships to are never visible on the map.
SPHLP034*#*At the beginning, there are only a few destinations on your map. New portions of the map will be uncovered as you’ll progress. The first chance to Explore will appear after you reach level 25.
SPHLP035*#*Most of the destinations have limited amount of materials. Once you carry all the material away, the destination will level up, you will receive an XP reward and the destination will start giving you more materials. Each destination gives your ship a bonus on the capacity. The bonus of the destination increases with the destination’s levels. With this progress the crew cost raises as well, so it is necessary to upgrade your ships to be able to fulfill the destination’s conditions.<br/> <br/>Some special destinations give you commodities which can be storable in the Warehouse only. You will reach these destinations after completing quests from certain contractors. First one is Columbus, who gives you Cocoa plantation with unlimited sources of cocoa.
SPHLP036*#*Click the map to check your fleet overview which will show you the location of your ships, remaining time for their return to your port, materials they carry and also their current destination.
SPHLP037*#*After level 20, a Shipwreck will appear on your map once a day. You can send your ship here to get some extra materials and XPs. After completing the journey, the next Shipwreck will spawn after 22 hours. The sail cost required by Shipwreck increases with your level. The capacity of the ship does not affect the reward.

SPTG001*#*But first, help me out and wake up the fisherman. That guy takes a nap every few minutes.
SPTG002*#*Good! I can see you catch on quickly.
SPTG003*#*The fish will come in handy. The guys at the Sawmill are hungry.
SPTG004*#*Great! You built the Main Dock so the ships can anchor in our port.
SPTG005*#*Now you can buy your first ship, Le Grace. You will find her in the shop.
SPTG006*#*Isn’t she a beauty? Let’s send her out to the sea.
SPTG007*#*Wait! Aren’t you the captain who is supposed to take over here? Fine, so show me your navigation skills!
SPTG008*#*Get behind the rudder and let’s set out on the maiden voyage!
SPTG009*#*Now, look here, captain! This is the world map. You can see our closest surroundings here.
SPTG010*#*Just select the destination for your ship.
SPTG011*#*We are sailing to Small Town. They have a great gold mint there.
SPTG012*#*Let’s set sail! We will be back in one minute.
SPTG013*#*New land ahead, captain! Get ready to explore the unknown.
SPTG014*#*That is a rich treasure indeed! You have found your first gems in the treasure chest.
SPTG015*#*Gems are a rare and valuable currency. You can use them to buy wonderful ships or to speed up your progress.
SPTG016*#*Our lumberjacks at the Sawmill love fish. Don’t forget to feed them and they will supply you with wood. Otherwise, they will take a nap.
SPTG017*#*It’s time, captain! You have enough resources to upgrade the Main Dock. Do it so you can expand your fleet by one more ship.
SPTG018*#*We could use more fish, right? Upgrade the Fishing Pier and you can hire an additional fisherman. Let’s catch us some fresh fish, captain!
SPTG019*#*Do you like cocoa, captain? If you want to earn some gold instead of eating it, you can sell it in the Market Town.
SPTG020*#*Cocoa, like all other commodities, can be sold on the market. Sometimes a contractor might ask them of you. So keeping a few in the warehouse might be good.
SPTG021*#*All commodities are stored in your warehouses. Don’t forget to upgrade them to expand their capacity.
SPTG022*#*Welcome to my humble port, sailor! Drop off your things and take a look around.
SPTG023*#*Our lumberjacks are overwhelmed with all that work. We should upgrade the Sawmill and hire more workers. They will be able to produce more wood and everyone will be happy.
SPTG024*#*Finally! I was expecting you...
SPTG025*#*There is no time for chit-chat now. We need to focus on our upcoming sail.
SPTG026*#*Could you please help me to build Main Dock?
SPTG027*#*Thanks for waking up our fisherman. That guy takes a nap every few minutes.
SPTG028*#*Fish are what makes our port run smoothly. After all, no one can work on an empty stomach!
SPTG029*#*Watch out for your fingers! Wood is necessary for new ships and port development.
SPTG030*#*We have got a problem, captain. To reach this destination you need a larger crew than your ship can accommodate.
SPTG031*#*But don’t worry. We have an easy solution to that. Just upgrade your ship to increase the crew and capacity.
SPTG032*#*If you can’t upgrade your ship, you will have to use another one to sail to this destination.
SPTG033*#*Do you see the Town Hall in the middle of the town?
SPTG034*#*This is the most important building in your port. You can’t progress and upgrade other buildings before upgrading the Town Hall.
SPTG035*#*It’s time we started saving up for that important upgrade!
SPTG036*#*So you have found the Warehouse. Here are all the commodities you have collected.
SPTG037*#*Commodities are used to complete some contracts for the contractors. You can also sell them by sending a ship to the Market Town.
SPTG038*#*To increase the capacity of the warehouse just upgrade it.
SPTG039*#*Great! The Town Hall was upgraded to level 2 and now you can upgrade all the other buildings too.
SPTG040*#*You have just sent the ship %s to the docks and freed one spot in your fleet.
SPTG041*#*If you want to use this ship again, you can find her in Your Ships and put her into active service.
SPTG042*#*The first cargo is safely in the port. But there is no time to rest, captain. Let's send your ship off to the next voyage!
SPTG043*#*You are now in charge of this port and its prosperity.
SPTG044*#*I will give you a few hints in the Captain’s Tasklist so you know what needs to be done. If you complete all three tasks, a nice reward will be yours.
SPTG045*#*But remember, figuring out how to develop your port best is up to you.

SPTT002*#*Welcome aboard!
SPTT003*#*Before you fully immerse into the history of ships and marine transport, let us help you with some basics in this game.<br /><br />As one of the most experienced captains you are in charge of this harbor. Your goal is to expand this harbor along with your ship fleet. In order to be able to expand daily, you need to gather resources.<br /><br />There are two different ways how to gather resources:<br /><b>1. Fishing and production</b><br /><img src="{news_dir}tutorial001.png" /><br />Small fishing boats can collect the most basic resource, fish. Fish can be used for production of another material or used as a payment for various items.<br /><br /><b>2. Ship sailing</b><br /><img src="{news_dir}tutorial002.png" /><br />Staying just in the harbor has its limits. Luckily, you have fleet of ships which can be sent around the world to discover new resources or adventures. Just build the Main Dock and you can buy your first ship.
SPTT004*#*Welcome to Seaport, captain!<br/> <br/>Take a minute and let us show you around. You are in charge of this small port. It’s up to you to develop it into a prosperous home port of a naval fleet.<br/> <br/>To build and upgrade buildings and ships you need resources. You can obtain them in two ways: <br/> <br/>1. By fishing and production in your port<br/> <img src="{news_dir}tutorial001.png" /> </br>Collect fish from the fishermen on the pier. Feed them to the workers in the production buildings in your port and they will produce various materials for you.<br/> <br/>2. By sailing<br/> <img src="{news_dir}tutorial002.png" /> </br>Buy the Main Dock and start building your fleet. The ships can bring you the materials from the destinations on the map.</br> <br/>But that’s not all! Discover more of Seaport on your voyage through the game. <br/> <br/>Happy sailing, captain!
